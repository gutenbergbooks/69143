CHAPTER I.
</h3>

<p class="intro">

Artemas, the scribe</i>.  3 <i>The
state of the land of Eur</i>.
4 <i>Concerning Willi, who
ruled over the men of Hu</i>.
7 <i>Concerning Mud, that

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
The words of Artemas
of the scribes
that <i>were</i> in Lon in the
land of En.
</p>

<p>
2 Of the things that
were and of the things
that were to be:
concerning men and the
things that men did do.
</p>

<p>
3 ¶ Now there was
peace over all the land
of Eur and amongst all
the nations that abode
there, it was a time of
great content.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ But Willi, who
ruled over the men of
Hu, was a crafty man
and greedy, and <i>his
ways</i> were devious.
</p>

<p>
5 And when he
beheld the prosperity of
the land and the
industry of those that dwelt
round about, and <i>that</i>
they did live in peace,
the one with the other,
his heart grew black
within him and his soul
vomited envy.
</p>

<p>
6 <i>Moreover</i>, he was a
proud man and ambitious
withal.  His covetousness
was like unto a
tree, that being planted
in fertile ground,
flourisheth mightily; and the
independence of the
peoples <i>was</i> as gall unto
his vanity.
</p>

<p>
7 ¶ Now the son of
Willi was a young man,
and he was puffed out
with pride and his mind
was empty; in his
living, he was vicious, and
his name, <i>it was</i> Mud.
</p>

<p>
8 And when Mud saw
that his father's soul
was torn with the
violence <i>of</i> his envy and
that he coveted that
<i>which</i> was not his, it
rejoiced him exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ And he laid
<i>himself</i> out to entice his
father, and did speak
many specious words
unto him, and was for
ever <i>at him</i>.
</p>

<p>
10 And Mud said
unto his father, All
Highest, hail!  And Willi
answered him, saying,
Thou <i>art</i> my son: And
Mud said unto him,
Great art thou above all
the kings of the earth,
for thou hast served the
Lord faithfully throughout
the days of thy life.
</p>

<p>
11 And Willi
answered him, <i>saying</i>,
Verily have I found
favour in the sight of the
Lord; and in my sight
has the Lord <i>also</i> found
favour.
</p>

<p>
12 And Mud looked
upon his father <i>from
the side</i>; he gazed upon
his countenance with a
furtive look, and <i>did see</i>
that his father's vanity
was without bounds.  So
he spake unto him
again, saying,
</p>

<p>
13 Thy shadow is as
the sun whose rays
bring forth warmth,
<i>giving</i> life unto all them
that are beneath it.
</p>

<p>
14 And Willi said,
That <i>which</i> thou sayest
is indeed true; yet doth
the sun shine over all
the world whilst my
shadow is for ever at
two hours <i>after</i> summer
noon.
</p>

<p>
15 And Mud answered
him, saying, In the
evening of thy days <i>shall</i>
thy shadow grow long,
and it shall spread its
shade over all the world;
for <i>it is</i> a good world
and deserveth well of
thee.  And the Lord
will surely reward thee
for all thy righteousness.
</p>

<p>
16 And Willi said,
Verily, art thou my son,
and in wisdom art thou
second only to thy
father.  I will make me a
covenant with the Lord,
and it shall come to pass
that I <i>shall have</i>
dominion over all the earth
and over all the waters
that are on the earth.
And whatsoever shall be
<i>left over</i>, that will I give
unto the Lord for <i>to be</i>
His own.
</p>

<p>
17 And I will <i>make</i>
might right, and them
that bow not down
before me, those will I
surely slay, both they
and their wives and
their children and the
stranger that is within
their gates.  And their
oxen will I take <i>as an
offering</i> unto my
Majesty.  And their
household goods shall be mine
by the strength of my
sword.
</p>

<p>
18 And he said unto
Mud, <i>that was</i> his son,
Send thou unto me a
wise man that I <i>may</i>
take counsel of him.
</p>

<p>
19 ¶ And a certain
man whose name was
Bern was sojourning in
the land, and him did
Mud bring unto his
father, <i>having</i> first
instructed him privily.
</p>

<p>
20 And when he that
<i>was</i> called Bern came
into the presence of the
king, he bowed him low,
saying, Hail, O king!
</p>

<p>
21 ¶ And he began to
speak, saying, There
was a certain husbandman
and he planted him
an oak in a place <i>where</i>
trees grew;
</p>

<p>
22 And it came to
pass that the oak grew
up and its roots spread
themselves about.  And
<i>there was</i> not room
enough in that place,
and the trees that were
planted there <i>before</i>
rose up and choked
it so that it did
languish away until there
was no sap remaining
<i>in it</i>.
</p>

<p>
23 And when the
husbandman saw <i>how</i> it
was, he sent his servant
with an axe and he told
him to cut down <i>the
trees</i> that were round
about.
</p>

<p>
24 Yea, every tree
except the oak did he
command him to cut down,
so that there <i>was</i> room,
and the oak did flourish
as the cedars <i>that are</i>
in Lebanon, and its
branches did sway them
over all the world.
</p>

<p>
25 And Willi said
unto him, Explain unto
me the meaning of this
parable, thou very wise
man.  <i>Of what</i> is the
oak and <i>of what</i> the
trees that were round
about?
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ And Bern
answered him, <i>saying</i>, The
nurseryman is the Lord
of Hosts.  The oak that
He planted, it is
thyself, O king; and the
trees that would choke
it, they are the
nations that dwell round
<i>about</i>.
</p>

<p>
27 The axe is thine
army, and the servant
of the husbandman is
he whom thou <i>shalt
make</i> to be the captain
over all thine host.
</p>

<p>
28 And when Willi
heard <i>the things</i> that
the wise man did say,
he was well pleased;
wherefore he gave unto
him a cross, and <i>it was</i>
made of iron.
</p>

<p>
29 ¶ And <i>after</i> he
had made him secret
preparations, he went
out with a great
multitude of men and much
munition, and he made
him a war, <i>the</i> like
whereof was never
known on earth before.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Peace reigneth in En</i>.  2
<i>Internal discord is loosed</i>.
4 <i>The men of Ire have
much power</i>.  6 <i>They
obtain their demands</i>.  12
<i>Petty strife prevaileth</i>.
14 <i>The priests see
wickedness everywhere</i>.  19 <i>The
owners of ships raise their
hire</i>.  26 <i>The rulers are
blamed</i>.  27 <i>Concerning the
war scribes</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now there was peace
throughout all the
land of En, and the
noise of battle <i>was</i> afar
off.  And the merchants
of the world did bring
their wares for to sell
them, even fine cloth
and spices <i>that were</i>
rare did they bring in
their ships.
</p>

<p>
2 ¶ But he that
putteth away the sword
doth loosen the tongue;
wherefore it came to
pass that <i>there was</i>
great talk amongst the
rulers, and the mighty
men <i>did say</i> things, the
one against the other.
</p>

<p>
3 And there were
many jealousies
amongst them, and they
<i>did</i> utter spiteful
sayings <i>concerning</i> each
other; verily, they were
like unto evil-minded
children in a quarrel,
and <i>their</i> pettiness of
spirit was an abomination.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ Now an House
that is divided against
itself <i>will stand</i>
anything.  And when men
from the land of Ire
took power into their
own hands and did rule
over En, <i>there was</i> no
one amongst the rulers
to say them nay.
</p>

<p>
5 And the men of Ire
exacted tribute from the
rulers, and the people
of the land rebelled not;
for penury <i>doth</i> bring
forth wisdom, but
prosperity breedeth only
fools.  And the
prosperity of the land of En
<i>was</i> great.
</p>

<p>
6 ¶ And when the
men of Ire saw that <i>all
that</i> which they
demanded was given unto
them, they <i>did</i> make
them long faces, and
<i>did</i> grumble aloud, and
<i>did</i> utter groans in the
public places <i>and</i>
strange noises in the
portals of the House.
And when they had
thus prepared the way
<i>for it</i>, they did
straightways ask for more.
</p>

<p>
7 And a few that
dwelt in the land of En
<i>did make</i> them a stand,
saying, What we have
given unto you, <i>it is</i>
enough.  Therefore, get
ye hence, ye men of
Ire.
</p>

<p>
8 And the men of Ire
waxed very wroth, and
they did curse the men
of En and did swear
strange oaths <i>concerning
them</i>, so that they
that were weak amongst
the rulers began to
shiver in their sandals.
</p>

<p>
9 And they held them
a council together <i>in</i>
secret and did agitate
themselves greatly,
seeking <i>for a means</i>
whereby they might escape
from the wrath of the
men of Ire, for it was a
terrible wrath, <i>being</i>
very ugly.
</p>

<p>
10 And after one had
said one thing and
another had said another
thing, then <i>did</i> all them
that were gathered
together make them an
agreement, and they did
give unto the men of Ire
<i>all those things</i> that
they had demanded.
</p>

<p>
11 And the men of
Ire prepared them long
faces and did get them
ready <i>for</i> another
occasion.  Neither was the
day ever known when
any man <i>that was</i> from
Ire did render thanks
for that <i>which</i> he had
received.
</p>

<p>
12 ¶ And class
quarrelled with class, the
artisan <i>with</i> the master,
the noble <i>with</i> the serf,
the priests <i>with</i> the
people, and the fools <i>with</i>
one another.
</p>

<p>
13 And all those that
thought one thing did
contend with them that
did think another thing,
and the bickering <i>that
was</i> between them, it
was very great.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ And there were
those amongst the
priests that <i>did</i> travel
about the country, crying
out in a loud voice,
and saying, Wickedness!  Wickedness!  All
<i>is</i> wickedness!
</p>

<p>
15 And they did say
many things <i>concerning</i>
the young men and
<i>concerning</i> the damsels,
and also <i>concerning</i>
them both together.
And those that listened
unto them were amazed
that such things should
be; and some <i>there were</i>
that doubted.
</p>

<p>
16 And the priests
did raise their hands
<i>unto</i> heaven, saying,
Deliver us from evil.
And the people did
drop their hands
<i>towards</i> the earth, saying,
Deliver us from the
priests.
</p>

<p>
17 And notwithstanding
all that <i>which</i>
was said by the priests
and by them that did
<i>grub</i> into things, the
wickedness of the
people was in no wise
greater than the wickedness
<i>of the</i> other nations
of the world.
</p>

<p>
18 And this was the
state of the land of En
when Willi did make
him the War: but
<i>afterwards</i>, it was different.
For the rulers declared
them a truce, and no
longer cried out <i>after</i>
one another in the
public places; nevertheless,
the ardour <i>of the</i> priests
remained without
abatement, and there were
those amongst the
newsmongers <i>on both sides</i>
that did conceal their
partisanship in an ill
manner.
</p>

<p>
19 ¶ And because the
land of En was built
upon an island, therefore
was it necessary for
the food of the people
<i>to be</i> brought unto them
in ships.
</p>

<p>
20 And the men of
Hu did sink of these
ships a few, and the
rulers of the land <i>did</i> seize
a great number of <i>them</i>
for to carry the armies
and the implements of
war.  Wherefore the
number <i>of them</i> that
were available for to
bring the people's food,
it <i>was</i> less than before.
</p>

<p>
21 And they that did
own the ships that
remained did make them
new rates of freight <i>that
were</i> twofold, <i>and</i>
threefold, <i>and</i> fourfold
greater than those that
had been before.
</p>

<p>
22 And the merchants
did make them
higher prices for the
wares that they did sell;
and some did do so
because <i>it was</i> forced upon
them; and others did do
so because they were
greedy for the profits,
wherefore they spake
privily, the one unto
the other, saying, See,
brother, the opportunity
is <i>upon</i> us.
</p>

<p>
23 And because it
was <i>beyond</i> them and
they could devise no
plan against it,
therefore did the rulers of
the land hold themselves
aloof from all <i>these
things</i> for a full two
years.
</p>

<p>
24 Wherefore the
people did pay them
very dearly for everything
that they did eat,
and those that did sell
merchandise in the
market places, these grew
fat in a lean time.
</p>

<p>
25 And when the
people murmured, the
rulers spake soft words
unto them, saying,
Assuredly is your lot cast
in <i>an hard</i> place; even
so, the straits of the men
of Hu, are they not
worse than yours?  And
because it <i>was</i> war,
therefore <i>were</i> the
people easily appeased.
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ Nevertheless,
there were many that
complained because the
owners of the ships and
those that sold the
people's food did make
them profits such as
never before; and many
blamed the rulers that
did countenance such
things at a time when
<i>there was</i> war.
</p>

<p>
27 ¶ Now there were
<i>certain men</i> amongst
the scribes and they did
wage them the war <i>on</i>
paper.
</p>

<p>
28 And, <i>of these</i>,
Belloc did write him for the
great captains and for
them in authority, that
<i>they might</i> read and
learn and receive his
commandments.
</p>

<p>
29 And Blatch did
write him for the
common soldier, wherefore
the violence of his words
was <i>a thing</i> for delight,
demolishing all
contrary argument.
</p>

<p>
30 And Garv did
write him <i>so that</i> all
might read.  And
because <i>there was</i> nothing
that this man did leave
unwritten, therefore did
<i>those</i> that followed him
perforce forego their
sabbath meal.
</p>

<p>
31 And there was
also Horatio, being he
that <i>did</i> for ever step
into the breach; yea,
even into the breach
<i>that was not</i> there did
he step; and he wrote
<i>concerning</i> righteousness
and blood.
</p>

<p>
32 And there were
also others in great
number, and all <i>did</i>
write them freely and
as men that <i>did</i> know.
</p>

<p>
33 And when the
captains did not do those
<i>things</i> that had been
written down for <i>their</i>
instruction, then was
there much anger
amongst the war scribes,
and they did gnash
their teeth <i>in rage</i>.
</p>

<p>
34 Wherefore they
were continually

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now these were the
rulers in the land
of En in the days when
George that <i>was</i> the
Fifth did reign <i>and</i>
the Great War <i>was begun</i>.
</p>

<p>
2 There was Herbert,
and David, and Winston,
and Walter, and
Reginald, and Samuel,
and Simon, and Masterman,
and Augustine,
and Grey, and John,
and Haldane, and
Tennant; and <i>there were</i>
also others, whereof the
number was great
beyond computation.
</p>

<p>
3 ¶ And Herbert was
the man that was
responsible unto the
people, and he did take the
head place at the table
whereat the rulers did
sit.  And there was in
him an abundance of
patience such as no man
did ever have <i>before</i>;
and he did keep the
rulers together, all in one
body.
</p>

<p>
4 And in time of
discord he was like unto a
gentle shepherd <i>when</i>
the rams do fight, and
them that spake angrily
in the council chamber
he did soften with
honeyed words.
</p>

<p>
5 Nevertheless, there
were some that <i>did say</i>
wicked things concerning
him, and they did
compare him unto a
woman <i>that is advanced</i>
in years.
</p>

<p>
6 And Herbert had
taken unto himself a wife.
</p>

<p>
7 And when <i>the time</i>
came, he did leave
the head place at the
table whereat the rulers
did sit, and he did go.
</p>

<p>
8 ¶ Now before that
it <i>was</i> war, David was
an hated man; yet was
he also loved.  And
<i>afterwards</i> it came to pass
that he was a much
loved man, yet was he
also hated.
</p>

<p>
9 And David did
<i>many</i> things so that men
spake about him, saying,
Behold, he is like unto a
skeleton key that fitteth
all locks.  And <i>whatsoever</i>
there is need of,
that thing will he surely do.
</p>

<p>
10 But <i>because</i> he
was new made and <i>did</i>
carry on, therefore he
lost favour with certain
of the Pharisees, and his
name did <i>become</i> an
abomination unto them.
Yet, when <i>the time</i>
came, he went up unto
the head place at the
table whereat the rulers
did sit.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ Now Winston
<i>was</i> a wild youth and
rash, hot of the tongue
and venturous in his
undertakings.  Nevertheless,
<i>he was</i> not lacking
in understanding.
</p>

<p>
12 And because he
was like unto new wine
when the vintage is
good, therefore did they
set him down in a place
that was cool, <i>saying</i>,
Peradventure, in a
little time, there will be
maturity.
</p>

<p>
13 ¶ And Walter was
over all them that did
deal in merchandise,
and he sojourned
amongst the rulers
<i>during</i> many months.  And
the things that he did
do, what man knoweth
thereof?  And when <i>the
time</i> came, he did go.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ Now Reginald
was blessed with an
heart that was overflowing
<i>with</i> the milk of human
kindness, and the
lot of the immigrants
from the land of Hu
did move him mightily,
so that he <i>did weep</i>
tears.
</p>

<p>
15 And there were
many of these men in
the land of En, some <i>of
them</i> being there that
they might make money,
and some <i>of them</i> were
come for to spy out the
land.
</p>

<p>
16 But Reginald <i>did</i>
scorn to make him a
distinction between them,
fearing lest some man
should say, See, there is
<i>one</i> that he favoureth.
</p>

<p>
17 Neither would he
lay himself out to
hinder any man that was
earning his bread; and
the spies <i>that were</i> in
the land, it was their
means of livelihood.
</p>

<p>
18 Therefore did he
uphold them, each man
in his place, <i>because</i> he
<i>was</i> Reginald.  Wherefore
there were many
that conceived him weak
<i>unto</i> foolishness.  And
when <i>the time</i> came, he
did go.
</p>

<p>
19 ¶ And unto Samuel
was given power
over all the cities of En.
And this man's name
was not for ever in the
mouths of the people,
neither did they
concern themselves at all
<i>with the things</i> that he
did do.  Nevertheless,
<i>he was</i> not an idle man.
But when <i>the time</i>
came, he did go.
</p>

<p>
20 ¶ Now Simon was
a man that was strange
in his beliefs, neither
<i>was</i> he an help in time
of trouble.  And there
were some that, seeking
the reason for his
<i>falling away</i> in the time of
his country's tribulation,
did say he was
<i>possessed</i> of a devil.
</p>

<p>
21 And he was a man
peaceable beyond all
reason, <i>so that</i> he did
put himself against the
patriots of the land of
En when they did set
them out for to wage
war in a cause that <i>was</i>
just.
</p>

<p>
22 And because he
and those that were
with him <i>were</i> as a
voice that crieth in the
wilderness, therefore he
did get him out from the
inner chamber wherein
did sit the rulers of the
land, and he <i>did</i> make
one cause with them
<i>that did</i> for ever carp
and cavil.
</p>

<p>
23 And when the
counsellors assembled
together for to make
them ordinances <i>for the</i>
salvation of the country,
then would Simon rise
upon his feet and he
would make him an
objection; therefore was
he an hindrance unto
them that did strive
<i>against</i> the perils that
beset the land.
</p>

<p>
24 And Simon was
not loved in the country
of En.  Yet was he
earnest in the things that
he did do, being a man
with a conviction <i>that is</i>
founded amiss.
</p>

<p>
25 ¶ And he that was
chief amongst all the
rulers did say, on an
occasion, Find thou me
<i>the</i> man; then will I
find <i>the</i> office.  So they
found him Masterman.
And when <i>the time</i>
came, he did go.
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ Now Augustine
<i>was</i> a great sage, and
there was no man in all
the land of En that did
surpass him in the
knowledge <i>that is</i> gotten
of books.  <i>Therefore</i>
they did make him to
rule over the land of Ire.
</p>

<p>
27 And on a time
when he was deep in
engagement with the
words of the ancient
Greeks, behold, the men
of Ire stole up secretly
and they fell upon his
servants <i>so that</i> many of
them did die.
</p>

<p>
28 And when it was
told unto Augustine
what the men of Ire <i>had</i>
done unto his servants,
he <i>was</i> filled with a
great wonder and his
breast <i>was</i> torn with
sorrow.  And because it
was <i>a thing</i> that liked
him not, therefore did
he remove <i>himself</i> from
amongst the seats of the
rulers, neither returned
he thither again.
</p>

<p>
29 ¶ Now the chief of
the scribes that did
write unto the rulers of
the nations <i>concerning</i>
matters, his name was
Grey, And he did <i>send</i>
him epistles unto the
four corners of the
earth, <i>saying</i> this and
<i>saying</i> that.
</p>

<p>
30 And to him there
were given many tasks
that were difficult, and
he did not always find
favour with the people;
for there are some that
look <i>from afar</i> towards
the end, but the stones
<i>that are</i> upon the way,
them do they count not
at all.
</p>

<p>
31 And it was said
concerning him that he
was a man of strength
in time of stress, but in
the <i>leading up</i> and
<i>afterwards</i>, then was he
weak as twine that is
boiled, and slow as
water standing in a pond.
</p>

<p>
32 But many of the
things that he <i>did</i> do
were good, and his name
was not without honour
in the land.  Yet when
<i>the time</i> came, he did go.
</p>

<p>
33 ¶ John, that was
also called Honest, was
another of them that
<i>believed</i> not in war.
Therefore he did hide
himself away in the
shadows of oblivion;
but he hindered not the
rulers in their endeavour.
</p>

<p>
34 ¶ Now Haldane
was the Keeper of the
King's Conscience in
the land of En, and he
was a man that <i>was</i>
learned in the ways of
the men of Hu, for his
spirit abode amongst
them; and the King of
Hu, he <i>did</i> love him as
a brother.
</p>

<p>
35 And the time came
when all the people
cried out with a loud
voice, saying, Haldane
must go!  But because
the winds did blow in an
<i>high quarter</i>, he heard
them not.
</p>

<p>
36 And there was a
certain man and his
name was Northcliffe.
And it came to pass that
when <i>he</i> cried out,
behold, his voice <i>did</i> rise
<i>even as</i> the winds, and
it was above the shouts
of all the other people.
</p>

<p>
37 And when Northcliffe
had raised his
voice for a long time so
that his throat was raw,
being like unto the flesh
of a kid <i>that is</i> newly
killed,
</p>

<p>
38 And when all the
people had joined with
him, shouting in a
mighty voice that did
<i>shake</i> the seats of the
rulers with the violence
of its clamour,
</p>

<p>
39 Then did Haldane
hear, and he hearkened
unto them.
</p>

<p>
40 And the people
rejoiced them exceedingly,
thinking it not good for
one that had been <i>in
with</i> the men of Hu to
hold an high position in
the land.
</p>

<p>
41 ¶ Now Tennant
was adroit of the
tongue.  And when
certain <i>of the</i> counsellors
questioned him closely,
seeking that they might
entrap him, he would
answer them with a
multitude of words;
nevertheless would he
not say <i>anything</i>.  And
when <i>the time</i> came, he
did go.
</p>

<p>
42 ¶ And concerning
the <i>other</i> rulers of the
land of En <i>at the
beginning</i> of the Great War,
is it not written in the
Book of Stubbs?  Both
their names and the
streets wherein they did
have <i>their</i> habitations,
thou shalt find them in
that Book in <i>the order</i>
that is of the alphabet.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>The caution of the rulers</i>.
4 <i>They make them a
censor</i>.  11 <i>The people
complain</i>.  14 <i>They tell the
people more</i>.  15 <i>And
appoint Balf to speak
concerning the navy</i>.  20 <i>He
doeth so</i>.  26 <i>And
becometh a laughing stock</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now when the rulers
of the land made
them a war, they
became very wary, fearing
lest their enemies
should discover <i>those
things</i> that they had in
store for them.
</p>

<p>
2 And they said, the
one unto the other, It
were prudent to say
nothing unto the
common people <i>concerning</i>
what we have done.  In
this manner shall we
preserve their peace of
<i>mind</i>, and it will be a
means also whereby we
may throw dust in the
eyes of the men of Hu.
But <i>after</i> it is all over,
then will we tell the people.
</p>

<p>
3 And because the
thing that they did
contemplate was not
possible, <i>therefore</i> were
they constrained to tell
unto the people <i>certain
things</i> concerning the
war and <i>how</i> went the
day.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ Nevertheless, they
<i>were</i> affrighted lest the
people should learn <i>too
much</i>, and so they made
them a censor.  And this
<i>was</i> one that would say,
This is so, and this only;
the rest, <i>it is</i> not so.
</p>

<p>
5 And they that sold
news unto the people
were vastly provoked,
for it liked them not to
be told <i>the things</i> that
they should say; also
was it an hindrance
<i>unto them</i> to be
circumscribed by the truth.
</p>

<p>
6 And when they
came into the presence
of the censor and bowed
themselves low before
him (for he was a great
man), he <i>would</i> have
none of them.
</p>

<p>
7 And he would say
unto them, These three
lines, <i>they are</i> official:
but the other things that
<i>have</i> happened, they did
happen not at all.
</p>

<p>
8 And those amongst
the newsdealers that did
<i>know something</i> would
foam at the mouth in
the violence of their
rage.  And <i>they</i> would
spit upon the floor and
would utter deep curses.
</p>

<p>
9 And because <i>he was</i>
an orderly man, therefore
did the censor make
him a scheme for the
better administration of
all <i>those things</i> that
were within his
authority.  And the scheme
that he did make, <i>it was</i>
this.
</p>

<p>
10 After a thing had
become known in the
land of Hu for <i>the space</i>
of thirty days, then
would he deliberate in
his mind concerning it.
And if it seemed good
<i>unto him</i>, after seven
days had passed he
would impart it unto
the people.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ And there was a
great outcry throughout
all the land, for this was
but one of <i>many things</i>.
Verily, the patience of
Job was not tried as the
patience of the men of
En in the days when
they waged war.
</p>

<p>
12 And the people
said unto the rulers,
Why do ye these things,
ye <i>men</i> of little
understanding?  Are we
children that ye treat us
thus, and have ye no
faith in the strength of
<i>our</i> conviction?
</p>

<p>
13 <i>All those things</i>
that are safe for us to
know, them shall ye tell
unto us.  And if the
tidings be good, assuredly
we will rejoice.  And if
the tidings be bad, they
shall but serve to fortify
our purpose.  The
tempest disturbeth the
waters, the tempest
<i>revealeth</i> the rock.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ And the rulers
heard what the people
did say, and they
hearkened unto them.  And
<i>they said</i> unto him that
was the censor, The
people are complaining
<i>because</i> they know not
how goes the day.
Therefore shalt thou tell
them more about it: but
take care that <i>it be</i> not
much more.  And he
did that which the
rulers had told him to do.
</p>

<p>
15 ¶ And the rulers
of the land did also call
<i>unto them</i> a certain
man, and his name <i>was</i>
Balf.  And he was over
all the vessels of war, a
mighty force, supreme
upon the seas.
</p>

<p>
16 And they said
<i>unto him</i>, Because thou
<i>art</i> thou, therefore shalt
thou say unto the
people whatsoever seemeth
good unto thee.
</p>

<p>
17 For thou hast a
wise head <i>and</i> a still
tongue, and whatsoever
thou sayest, <i>it will</i> not
be too much.
</p>

<p>
18 Now it came to
pass that the vessels of
the men of En did fight
with the vessels of the
men of Hu in a great
battle, and it raged for
a <i>long</i> time.
</p>

<p>
19 And before it was
come to an end, behold,
the vessels of the men of
Hu did steal away
quickly and did <i>hide
them</i> in a mist, for the
day had not gone well
with them, and <i>they
were</i> sore afflicted.
</p>

<p>
20 ¶ And when word
was brought unto Balf
<i>concerning</i> the battle,
and <i>concerning</i> the
numbers that had
perished on both sides, he
did call the people unto
him, and he spake unto
them, saying,
</p>

<p>
21 Woe is this day
that hath brought
desolation unto En.  Know
ye, O my brothers, <i>how
many</i> be slain of them
that sailed against the
men of Hu?  Assuredly,
the number thereof, it is
very great.  And of the
vessels of war, <i>there be</i>
many destroyed.  Verily
is this a day <i>that is</i>
full of woe.
</p>

<p>
22 And when the
people heard that <i>which</i> he
did say unto them, they
were perturbed beyond
measure, fearing they
knew not what.
</p>

<p>
23 And after a certain
time had passed by,
he called the people
unto him again, and he
spake unto them, saying,
<i>Wherefore</i> are ye
perturbed and <i>why</i> cast
down?
</p>

<p>
24 Listen unto me, ye
men of gloom, and
rejoice at my words.  For
in that battle whereof I
have told you, <i>many</i>
perished that sailed
from En; but amongst
the men of Hu there was
carnage <i>that was</i> great
beyond compare.  And
that day did see our
adversary vanquished in
the fight.
</p>

<p>
25 And they that
heard him were amazed
and said, the one unto
the other, What <i>strange</i>
fruits, <i>these</i>, of his
philosophy!
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ But the news-mongers
gloried in his
foolishness, <i>because</i> he
was the mouthpiece of
the rulers.
</p>

<p>
27 Nevertheless, he
that <i>was</i> the censor
relaxed not his vigilance,
so that nothing was
known in the land of En
save only <i>those things</i>
that were necessary for
to quiet the people.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Concerning the changes
that were wrought by the
war</i>.  2 <i>The debtors are
given grace</i>.  4 <i>Strong
drink becometh hard to
get</i>.  10 <i>It groweth
difficult to make a journey</i>.
16 <i>The bazaars are closed
at an early hour</i>.  20 <i>Much
money is earned by the
workers</i>.  22 <i>The manner
of spending it</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
And these are <i>certain</i>
of the things that
did come to pass in the
land of En during
the days of the Great War.
</p>

<p>
2 ¶ Now immediately
that there <i>was</i> war,
grace was given unto
them that were in debt;
and that which they did
owe, for a certain time
<i>they did</i> not pay it.
</p>

<p>
3 Therefore was the
war a mixed blessing
unto such as <i>these</i>, and
in those places <i>that are</i>
beyond the Gate of
Notting Hill, the days of
grace were welcomed
with the sound of
timbrels and there was
much rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ And those that
drank not strong drink
set them to work.  And
they concealed <i>their
purpose</i> beneath the
shadow of the war, and
they prevailed upon the
rulers <i>to be</i> an help unto
them.
</p>

<p>
5 And so <i>it was</i> that
the doors of the taverns
were closed against the
people save only for five
hours during the day;
neither was it lawful <i>for
them</i> to buy any strong
drink from the publicans
<i>except</i> at the time
appointed.
</p>

<p>
6 In this wise did the
water bibbers advantage
their object, for they
had rightly conceived
that the war <i>was</i> an
hefty lever wherewith
to work their will.
</p>

<p>
7 And those that
drank of the juice of the
grape did become quick
<i>at the</i> swallow, for the
time that they did have,
it <i>was</i> short.
</p>

<p>
8 And the preachers
and all those that <i>did</i>
meddle with the
independence of the people
were filled with pious
joy, and they rejoiced in
their tabernacles of
stone and of tin, and in
their habitations <i>also</i>,
saying, Thus are the
wicked punished <i>and</i>
the thirsty sent empty
away.
</p>

<p>
9 And because the
publicans were the
people to <i>go for</i>, and they
did know it, therefore
did they not complain;
and the <i>cocoa</i> gulpers
triumphed on that day.
</p>

<p>
10 ¶ Now there were
many sojourning in the
land of En that came of
an hostile country.  And
because <i>they were</i> a
danger unto the state,
therefore did the rulers
make <i>new</i> laws concerning <i>them</i>.
</p>

<p>
11 And to <i>this</i> end,
whosoever did travel
unto certain places was
commanded to write
him his name in a book
that <i>was</i> at the inn
where he did rest.
</p>

<p>
12 Now when a man
and a woman did journey
unto the sea and did
sojourn there <i>for a</i>
week-end, then would
they say unto all and
sundry, Behold, a priest
has licensed us to do
this thing, for <i>we are</i> wed.
</p>

<p>
13 And sometimes it
<i>was</i> so: but there were
some that did lie about
it, hoping <i>perchance</i> to
save them lodgment
money, or fearing to
offend the righteous.
</p>

<p>
14 Therefore was the
new law a cause of
vexation <i>unto them</i>, for to
write in a book their
true names, it was not
wise; and to write them
names that were false, it
was a dangerous thing
<i>and</i> costly withal.
</p>

<p>
15 And though many
complained in secret,
nevertheless, there was
no <i>change</i> made in the
law, for the rulers of the
land did rightly own
no knowledge <i>touching</i>
such affairs; and they
that <i>did</i> transgress did
pay the penalty.
</p>

<p>
16 ¶ And <i>it was</i>
ordained that all the
bazaars throughout the
land should close them
their doors at eight
hours after midday.
</p>

<p>
17 Yea, even <i>unto
them</i> that sold tobacco
and unto the vendors of
sweet stuffs was the
mandate sent.  And
<i>because</i> these were used to
ply their trades by
night as well as by day,
therefore did the order
seem the more amazing
unto them.
</p>

<p>
18 And the damsels
liked it not <i>because of</i>
their stomachs.  And
when a man did go for
to buy him cigarettes
and <i>it was</i> too late, he
would utter maledictions
upon the doorstep;
and the next time he
<i>would</i> remember.
</p>

<p>
19 And in the time of
his extremity the
married man did borrow
from his wife; and <i>it
did</i> cost him dear
because she <i>did have</i> her
price.  Verily, whatsoever
she desired, that
did she get <i>out of</i> him,
for the moment <i>was</i>
favourable unto her purpose.
</p>

<p>
20 ¶ And many were
put to labour on munitions,
and they <i>did</i> work
them long hours at a
goodly recompense.
</p>

<p>
21 And when the
week <i>was come</i> unto its
end, then did they
receive their hire; and
because <i>it was</i> a lot of
money, they knew not
what <i>to do</i> with it.
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ And some
bought them musical
instruments; wherefore
was there great
complaining <i>amongst</i> those
that lived round about,
for the noise that they
did make was as the
harmony of the damned.
</p>

<p>
23 And amongst the
women, there were <i>some</i>
that bought them
feathers and ribands of a
gaudy hue; and they
adorned <i>themselves</i>
most wonderfully.
</p>

<p>
24 And whensoever
they ventured forth into
the public places, there
<i>was</i> a stir amongst the
populace.  Yea, verily,
from the north <i>unto</i> the
south, and from the east
<i>unto</i> the west, wheresoever
they appeared, the
people were amazed at
the strangeness of their
garb.
</p>

<p>
25 But there were
many that <i>being</i> full of
wisdom and aflame with
love of En, did lend a
part of that <i>which</i> they
earned unto the rulers
of the land <i>for</i> to
buy them munitions of war.
</p>

<p>
26 And, howsoever
much it was, it did
breed them profits
during every year that it
was <i>away</i>, so that they
prospered and became
men of substance.
</p>

<p>
27 Nevertheless, there
was fear <i>in them</i> that
when the war was come
to an end the rulers
would take from each so
<i>much</i>, saying unto him,
A good and faithful
servant has thou been
and prudent, and thou
<i>wast</i> an help unto us
<i>when</i> we had need of
thee.  And now, listen:
</p>

<p>
28 Inasmuch as thy
brothers have wasted
their substance on idle
<i>things</i> of no account,
therefore are they
become paupers, and they
<i>are</i> hungerstarved.
</p>

<p>
29 But thou <i>hast</i> been
saving in the past and
thine hire has bred thee
profits.  Thy foresight
has delivered thee from
want <i>during</i> all the days
of thy life.
</p>

<p>
30 Therefore shalt
thou pay so much <i>unto
each</i> of thy poor brethren,
for in this wise they
shall have subsistence
that <i>will</i> keep them safe
from want.
</p>

<p>
31 And the wasters
winked them each the
<i>left</i> eye, for they knew
full well that when <i>the
time</i> came that they
were impoverished, then
would the thrifty ones
be taxed for to feed
them.
</p>

<p>
32 For the frugal
man <i>shall</i> sweat; but the
waster, he shall lap it
up.  And so <i>it was</i> in
the land of En.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>The chief amongst the tax
gatherers speaketh unto
the people</i>.  5 <i>They
hearken unto him</i>.  9 <i>Wherefore
the price of paper
increaseth</i>.  12 <i>The people are
divided amongst themselves
concerning the notes
of paper</i>.  17 <i>The nature
thereof</i>.  19 <i>The people
lend their money unto the
rulers</i>.  26 <i>And the land
of En becometh mighty</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
And <i>because</i> there
was war, therefore
did he that was chief
amongst the tax gatherers
send word unto the
people regarding <i>what</i>
they should do.  And he
said unto them, Hearken
unto me, all ye men
of wealth, and <i>obey</i> my
behests.
</p>

<p>
2 Ye know that the
hosts of En <i>are</i> gone out
against a mighty enemy,
against a strong foe and
one <i>that</i> is wary.  And
his armaments are
terrible beyond anything
seen by men before.
Therefore it behoves us
to gird up our loins for
the fray, because it will
be a fight <i>unto</i> the
death.
</p>

<p>
3 And all the gold
that ye have, that bring
ye <i>unto me</i>, and I will
give you notes <i>that are</i>
of paper in place of it.
And whatsoever ye may
buy with gold, <i>that</i> may
ye also buy with the
notes of paper.
</p>

<p>
4 And our strength
will be great amongst
the nations, for gold
<i>maketh</i> a good ambassador.
And we will buy
us deadly engines of
war and munitions in a
great quantity, for a
long purse <i>sufficeth</i> in
all things.
</p>

<p>
5 ¶ And so the people
<i>did</i> bring gold unto the
rulers, some in pieces of
ten, some in pieces of an
hundred, and some in
pieces of a thousand.
Verily, <i>whatever</i> gold
the people did have,
that did they bring with
them.
</p>

<p>
6 And as the people
delivered their gold
unto <i>the one</i> appointed,
he would say unto them,
How many pieces of
gold hast thou brought,
brother?  And he would
answer them, <i>saying</i>,
Such and such a
number have I brought.
</p>

<p>
7 And he would
exchange him the gold for
notes of paper, <i>even</i> one
note of paper for each
piece of gold that <i>he did</i>
bring with him.
</p>

<p>
8 And the weight of
gold that was exchanged
in those days, it was
very heavy, <i>so that</i> it
did take seven hundred
seventy and seven thousands
of elephants for to
move it.
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ And the number
of the notes of paper
was <i>beyond</i> all counting.
Wherefore there
was a dearth of paper in
the land and the price
<i>of it</i> became an high one.
</p>

<p>
10 And they that
were dealers in books
demanded five shekels of
silver for their wares;
and <i>before</i>, they did ask
only four shekels of
silver and six pieces of
copper.
</p>

<p>
11 Nevertheless, there
yet remained <i>some</i> in
the land that bought
them books <i>for</i> to read:
and <i>the rest</i> of the
people, recking not the
waste of paper, did take
up their pens, and they
did write.  And Artemas,
the scribe, he <i>was</i>
one of these.
</p>

<p>
12 ¶ And because it
was not the custom in
the land of En to use
notes of paper, save
amongst them <i>that were</i>
rich, therefore were the
people divided among
themselves <i>concerning
it</i>, whether it were for
an advantage.
</p>

<p>
13 And those that
were careless in their
manner of living, they
liked it not.  But the
others, they <i>were</i>
content, for the notes of
paper were without
weight, and the space
that they did occupy, it
was small.
</p>

<p>
14 And when a man,
<i>thinking</i> it a bill that
was not paid, did throw
away a note of paper
that was worth twenty
shekels of silver, then
would he curse aloud,
using <i>new</i> words, and
he would affright the
passers-by with the
violence of his lamentations.
</p>

<p>
15 And because the
notes of paper were thin
and <i>did</i> stick themselves
<i>together</i>, therefore did
a debtor, <i>being</i>
unaware, sometimes give
the worth of two pieces
of gold unto him to
whom he owed but one.
</p>

<p>
16 And this man <i>also</i>
would sorrow cursefully
and he <i>would</i> tear his
hair.  And Willi, <i>that
was</i> the cause of it, he
would consign him unto
the nethermost part of
Hell.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ And the notes of
paper <i>were</i> not alike,
being writ in two
colours; and the one
colour, it was black, <i>and</i>
the other colour, <i>it was</i>
red.
</p>

<p>
18 And one of <i>those</i>
that were writ in black
was as much as two that
were writ in red;
wherefore, and because they
were passing rare, they
found great favour in
the eyes of the people.
</p>

<p>
19 ¶ Now it came to
pass that the rulers did
<i>have</i> a need of money
for to buy them
implements of war.  And they
sent word unto the
people <i>concerning it</i>.
</p>

<p>
20 And immediately
there arrived at the
receipt of custom a great
multitude of men, each
man bearing upon his
back a weight of money,
<i>according</i> to his means.
And they jostled, the
one against the other, in
their haste <i>to be</i> first.
</p>

<p>
21 And they said unto
the rulers of the land,
All that which we have
brought with us, that do
we lend unto you.  Go
ye out, <i>therefore</i>, and
buy ye the things <i>that
are</i> necessary.  Neither
shall ye stint yourselves
in the matter, but rest
assured that whatsoever
more ye shall require, it
<i>shall be</i> forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
22 And the notes of
paper that they did
bring unto the rulers of
the land were <i>in
number</i> as the blades of
grass in a meadow that
extendeth out of sight.
Yea, even <i>more</i> than the
words of the rulers was
the number thereof,
<i>notwithstanding</i> that the
jaws of these were for
ever agitated.
</p>

<p>
23 So the rulers of
the land did set out for
to buy them munitions
of war in a great
quantity; even all that <i>which</i>
they did require did
they set out for to buy.
</p>

<p>
24 And all the
merchants of the world
came in <i>unto them</i> and
displayed their wares
before them; and they
<i>were</i> eager for to make
the bargain and to
traffick with the rulers.
</p>

<p>
25 For the power of
money was great in that
time, and <i>the things</i> that
it could not do, they
<i>were</i> not.
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ And <i>because</i> the
people brought unto the
rulers money that <i>was</i>
of a value beyond
calculation, therefore was
the might of En felt
<i>throughout</i> all the
world.

CHAPTER VII.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>The country is bereft of
its young men</i>.  2 <i>The
rulers send unto the women</i>.
3 <i>Who make them munitions
of war</i>.  4 <i>And sell
merchandise in the
bazaars</i>.  8 <i>And watch over
the people</i>.  11 <i>They
receive much money</i>.  14
<i>Concerning a certain man
that imbibed too freely</i>.  23
<i>The women work on the
land</i>.  34 <i>They rebel</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now it came to pass
that all the young
men went forth for to
fight, and there
remained only those that
<i>were</i> old or infirm and
<i>some</i> that <i>had</i> sneaked
them through.
</p>

<p>
2 ¶ And <i>because</i> there
was much work to be
done, therefore did the
rulers of the land send
word unto the women,
saying, Come ye unto
the workshops of the
cities and there do all
<i>those things</i> that the
young men were wont
to do.  And they came
as with one accord.
</p>

<p>
3 ¶ And they did make
them munitions of war
of many kinds, and did
become skilled artificers,
<i>both</i> in metal and in
wood; and they rested
not from their labours,
save only <i>on the</i> days
appointed.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ And there were
others that <i>did</i> sell
merchandise in the bazaars.
And so it fell out that
when a man went forth
for to buy him
under-vestments, the damsel
that was in the bazaar
<i>would say</i> unto him,
What is thy need, O son
of man?
</p>

<p>
5 And he was ashamed
to tell her <i>all that</i> which
was in his heart, and he
knew not what to say;
wherefore was he halting
in his speech and his
countenance did take on
the colour <i>of</i> blood.
</p>

<p>
6 But the maiden that
did tend unto his wants,
she was <i>in no wise</i>
disquieted, and she did
beseech him to impart
unto her the name of <i>the
thing</i>.
</p>

<p>
7 And, afterwards, she
did hold up the leg of
the garment for
appraisement and did raise
her voice in praise of it.
And the young man was
brought into a <i>proper
state</i> upon the instant,
so that he did buy
whatsoever she did shew
unto him.  And his going
out from that place <i>was</i>
quicker than his coming in.
</p>

<p>
8 ¶ And there were
women appointed for to
see that the people did
no wrong thing.  And
certain of these did
betake them on the dark
nights unto the quiet
places <i>at a time</i> when
the mating season was
nigh.
</p>

<p>
9 And they did flash
them a light <i>on those</i>
that were unready; but
those that did know
<i>about it</i>, them did they
find better circumstanced.
</p>

<p>
10 And the people
liked it not, for there
was no place that was
safe unto them, and the
course of true love was
<i>an hard one</i> and much
beset with spies.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ And because the
women were given high
places in the land,
therefore was their
recompense high <i>also</i>, and the
money that they did
earn, <i>it was</i> a large sum.
</p>

<p>
12 And so it came to
pass that certain men
that were mean of spirit
forsook their labours
and <i>became</i> idle.  And
when men spake unto
them <i>concerning it</i> and
upbraided them, they
answered them, saying,
Wherefore should we go
<i>about</i> it?  And why
should we toil?  Are not
our wives diligent, and
do they not provide for
us according to their
means?
</p>

<p>
13 And they that
heard them were filled
with a great aversion,
and they were glad in
their hearts that in all
the land of En there
<i>were</i> few men like unto
these.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ Now there was a
<i>certain</i> man and he did
imbibe of the juice of
the grape in a manner
that was not wise.
</p>

<p>
15 And every night
when he returned unto
his habitation he was
full up with strong
drink; and because he
sought his bedchamber
<i>in vain</i>, therefore would
he make him a couch
upon the mat <i>that was</i>
nigh unto the gate.
</p>

<p>
16 And it was a sore
trial unto his wife, <i>for</i>
she knew not what to do.
And she did cast about
in her mind, seeking to
devise some means
whereby to make him
whole.
</p>

<p>
17 And because she
was a woman wise
beyond the most, being
also strong and lusty,
<i>therefore</i> did she
contrive a plan; and she
became one <i>of them</i> that
looked after the people.
</p>

<p>
18 And the same
night when her husband
returned unto her, walking
in soulful meditation
<i>because</i> he was
drunk, then did she go
forth for to greet him;
and she came <i>upon him</i>
in the way.
</p>

<p>
19 And she called
unto her two women,
mighty of stature, that
were lying in ambush
near by.  And the
muscles of their arms were
<i>of a</i> size and their
strength was very great.
And they <i>took</i> him.
</p>

<p>
20 And it came to
pass upon the morrow
that he was brought
<i>before</i> the judge.  And
when he had heard all
that the women had to
say, he said unto him,
Assuredly <i>thou art</i> a
guilty man.
</p>

<p>
21 For thine
indiscretion thou shalt be
mulcted in forty shekels
of silver; and if thou
payest not <i>upon</i> the
nail, then shalt thou be
cast into prison, there to
remain <i>during</i> fourteen
days.
</p>

<p>
22 And because he
was a wise man when
the morning <i>was come</i>,
therefore he <i>paid</i> up;
and he returned unto
his home much chastened.
And from that
day forth he put all
strong drink away from
him, wherefore he <i>was</i>
called Tam-ed, which
signifieth, One that
hath <i>been</i> through it.
</p>

<p>
23 ¶ Now when the
harvest was ripe, and
there were no labourers
in the fields for to
gather it in, the
husbandmen <i>that were</i> on
the land became cast
down and they did make
them an outcry.
</p>

<p>
24 And certain
women approached unto
them, and said, Wherefore
are ye cast down,
ye wealthy <i>men</i> of the
fields?
</p>

<p>
25 Behold, we and
our sisters will gather in
the standing corn, and
<i>in the</i> winter we will
prepare the ground for
the crops that are <i>to be</i>.
</p>

<p>
26 And because it is
not <i>in them</i> to be
otherwise, therefore the
husbandmen changed not
their countenances that
were woeful; but they
said unto the women,
</p>

<p>
27 Forget ye not that
<i>ye are</i> what ye are.
Nevertheless, because ye
say it, <i>therefore</i> it shall
be so.  First shall ye
reap the harvest, and
afterwards shall ye do
the <i>other</i> things whereof
ye speak.
</p>

<p>
28 And so the women
laboured all day in the
fields.  And they did
take them cooling
drinks <i>amongst</i> the corn
when the sun was high,
and they did eat cream
<i>that was</i> rich unto
yellowness, and <i>also</i> pasties
in abundance.  Nevertheless,
when night was
come they <i>did</i> sleep;
neither did the things
that they had eaten lie
heavy upon <i>their</i> stomachs.
</p>

<p>
29 And so the harvest
was gathered in and
there was much rejoicing
because <i>of it</i>.  But
amongst the husbandmen
there was only
foreboding, for <i>such</i> do
never rejoice.
</p>

<p>
30 And when the
cold of the year was
come, the husbandmen
spake unto the women,
saying, Now is the time
when ye shall go forth
to prepare the ground
for the crops that are
<i>to be</i>.
</p>

<p>
31 And so the women
went forth.  And when
they had come unto the
place appointed, behold,
there was a great heap
before them, and <i>it was</i>
manure.  And the
husbandmen drew nigh and
they said unto the women,
</p>

<p>
32 All this shall ye
spread upon the fields,
and <i>more</i> also.  And it
shall come to pass, after
that <i>ye have</i> digged it
in, that the earth shall
be renewed; and the
crops that ye shall sow,
<i>these</i> shall flourish
exceedingly.  And the
husbandmen went their
way.
</p>

<p>
33 Now the heap <i>that
was</i> manure, it was an
abomination; and the
stink thereof was so
great that the women
did cover over their
nostrils with cambric and
with pieces of fine lace.
</p>

<p>
34 ¶ And they
followed <i>after</i> the
husbandmen with one
accord, and spake unto
them, saying, We did
gather in your corn,
even the oats and the
barley did we reap for
you: and the hay, we
did <i>make</i> it into stacks.
</p>

<p>
35 And the husbandmen
answered them,
<i>saying</i>, Verily all these
things whereof ye speak,
<i>them</i> did ye do.
</p>

<p>
36 And the women
said unto them, The
scent of the harvest was
sweet unto our nostrils;
but this heap <i>that is</i>
manure, it is a stinking
thing, and we will have
none of it.
</p>

<p>
37 So they turned
them about and hied
them unto the cities for
to become scribes.  And
they <i>did</i> spend the
wages of their first
week's hire upon a
measure of choice
perfume.  Nevertheless, the
stink of the heap <i>that
was</i> manure abode with
them during many days.

<p class="intro">
1 <i>The rulers make them new

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Take heed, all ye
that read, and pay
attention, for <i>these</i> are
the things that the
rulers of the land of En
<i>did</i> lay upon the people
at a time when there
was war.
</p>

<p>
2 ¶ Now they did
make them a law and
did enjoin upon all the
dealers in merchandise
that <i>they should</i> cease
from trafficking in the
market places in the
youth of the night; yea,
at eight hours <i>after</i>
midday were they
constrained to stop from
selling their wares and
merchandise.
</p>

<p>
3 And the reason
thereof was uncertain,
some saying it was <i>for a
means</i> of saving fuel,
whilst others did say it
was because those that
served in the bazaars
<i>were</i> few and needed
them rest.
</p>

<p>
4 But there were
many that did say it
<i>was</i> but the spirit of
interference that was rife
in the land; and they
were filled <i>with</i>
suspicion, thinking that the
<i>early</i> closers were
grinding them <i>their</i> axe.
</p>

<p>
5 ¶ And in the
summer season the rulers
did give unto the people
more light.  And <i>it was</i>
the light of day that
they bestowed, but
upon <i>the doings</i> of the
war they shed no more
light.
</p>

<p>
6 Now the giving of
more light was one of
the things that the
rulers did wisely,
<i>wherefore</i> the people did
praise them; and they
were amazed, for it was
not the custom amongst
the men of En to praise
the rulers <i>of</i> the land.
</p>

<p>
7 Neither was there
<i>often</i> cause therefor, for
a wise ruler is precious
<i>beyond</i> price, howbeit
many a fool is raised
unto an high place;
</p>

<p>
8 For the fool
speaketh <i>sometimes</i> wisdom,
and it <i>is</i> recorded.  But
the foolishness of fools
do men forget.
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ And certain men
did set them about for
to find a means whereby
they might <i>make</i> a good
<i>thing</i> out of the war.
</p>

<p>
10 And when word
was brought unto the
rulers <i>concerning</i> what
they were doing, they
did make them a law.
And they did take
unto themselves a certain
share from the profits
that <i>these</i> men did
gather in.
</p>

<p>
11 And those that
were at one with the
patriots complained
not; and those <i>that were</i>
making them <i>enough</i>,
neither did these complain.
</p>

<p>
12 <i>And</i> they that <i>did</i>
do things for the rulers
<i>out of</i> the generosity
of their hearts, even
these went not empty
away.
</p>

<p>
13 ¶ And there were
certain men amongst
the servants of the
rulers that did ask for
<i>sweet</i> oil, and they <i>did</i>
say unto the traders,
Grease thou the palms
of our hands that we
<i>may</i> bargain with thee
to thy advantage.
</p>

<p>
14 And those that
<i>were</i> found out were
cast into prison, and
their names did stink
<i>most</i> vilely <i>throughout</i>
the length and breadth
of the land.
</p>

<p>
15 ¶ And because it
was a prudent thing <i>to
do</i>, the rulers gave unto
them that had chariots
only <i>so much</i> of what
men called petrol as was
left <i>over</i>.  And the
hosts of En did receive
their portion before all
others.
</p>

<p>
16 Therefore those
that were wealthy
amongst the people used
not their chariots <i>save</i>
when there was need;
and they that were <i>used</i>
to joy ride, they did do
so no more.
</p>

<p>
17 For in all matters
were the people ready to
make them sacrifices
<i>unto</i> the needs of the
war, and they did do all
<i>those things</i> that were
<i>required of them</i> for to
bring nearer the end <i>of it</i>.
</p>

<p>
18 ¶ And a tax <i>was
made</i> upon all those
that did go unto the
theatre; yea, even upon
them that did view the
pictures and upon them
that did watch men
playing <i>with</i> a ball, <i>was</i>
the tax imposed.
</p>

<p>
19 And because it
was <i>not much</i>, and was,
moreover, a righteous
tax, they did pay it
gladly; and the number
of them that <i>did</i> go
unto such places, it was
not less <i>than</i> before.
</p>

<p>
20 ¶ And there were
other taxes also and
they were exceeding
heavy, <i>so that</i> all the
money that was paid by
the people unto the tax
gatherers <i>was</i> great
beyond anything that men
had thought possible.
</p>

<p>
21 Nevertheless <i>there
was</i> no murmuring in
the land, and the people
did push, the one
against the other, <i>to be</i>
first at the receipt of
custom, every man <i>with</i>
his money in his hand.
</p>

<p>
22 And he that was
the chief amongst all
the tax gatherers was
amazed.  And he spake
unto <i>several</i> concerning
it, saying, Are not these
that do shower their
gold <i>upon</i> me the same
that before did curse my
name?  When I asked
for a mite, <i>they</i> reviled
me shamefully; yet,
now I ask for much,
behold, they bring it
flowing <i>over</i>.  For he
understood not that this <i>was</i>
the spirit of the nation.
</p>

<p>
23 ¶ Now when there
was any matter that
was <i>beyond</i> the rulers so
that they knew not what
to do, they would
appoint them a commission
for to inquire <i>concerning</i> it.
</p>

<p>
24 And a commission
was an assembly of wise
men <i>that were</i> sometimes
foolish; and they
would gather themselves
together, and they
would question all and
sundry, and they would
talk.
</p>

<p>
25 But lest they
should do <i>some thing</i> in
their carryings on, the
rulers would give them
instruction and would
speak unto them, saying,
</p>

<p>
26 Go ye into a room
apart and <i>gather round</i>.
And send the young
men into the highways
and into the byways
that <i>they may</i> bring
unto you all them that
know aught concerning
<i>the matter</i>.  And
whatsoever they may say
unto you, that shall ye
hear.
</p>

<p>
27 Afterwards, ye
shall make us a report,
for <i>that</i> doeth injury
unto no man.  But woe
be unto you if ye shall
do <i>anything</i> that
exceedeth our commandment;
verily shall our
wrath burn thee up, and
thy bones shall fall
away into dust.
</p>

<p>
28 By this means did
the rulers put away for
a long time those things
that <i>were</i> vexatious unto
them, having faith in
the memory of the
people that <i>it was</i> short.
Therefore was a
commission unto the rulers
<i>as</i> a bag of sand unto
him that fighteth, for it
was a <i>shield</i>.  And the
day was not known
<i>whereon</i> the rulers
appointed them not a
commission.
</p>

<p>
29 ¶ But there was a
<i>certain</i> man and his
name was Northcliffe.
And the people were
divided into two camps
<i>concerning</i> him, some
saying that he <i>was</i> a
raiser of scares, whilst
others did say that he
<i>knew things</i>.  And all
were agreed that he was
a thorn in the side of
the rulers.
</p>

<p>
30 And when a
commission did bring its
report unto the rulers,
then did <i>these</i> retire
unto the privacy of
their bedchambers.
And the report they did
take <i>with them</i> for to
be a pillow unto their
heads.
</p>

<p>
31 And Northcliffe
would raise his voice on
high and he would say
many bitter words.
And he would arouse
them and would make
them <i>to do</i> things.
</p>

<p>
32 And though many
were against him
<i>because of it</i>, the good
that he did do was
manifest.  And because he
left not the rulers to
sleep, therefore did men
call him Helsabout,
<i>which meaneth</i> The
Awakener.

CHAPTER IX.

<p class="intro">

<i>Many errors are committed</i>.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now the rulers sent
them word unto all
the cities, saying, Let
<i>there</i> be no light; and
there was no light.
</p>

<p>
2 And every man did
hide his candle under a
bushel, else did he pay
for his rashness in many
shekels of silver.  Yea,
<i>there was</i> even darkness
upon the highways and
in those places <i>where</i>
the people <i>did</i> pass to
and fro.  And the darkness
did breed confusion.
</p>

<p>
3 Now they that lived
in Lon were in two
minds concerning it.
And some that did sell
merchandise in the
bazaars, they did make
them a noise, being
perturbed <i>because of</i> their
pockets.  And there
were others that did
utter loud manifestations
of joy.  And the old
women that were there,
<i>these</i> ventured not forth
after the sun was set.
</p>

<p>
4 And they that were
dealers in merchandise
did make loud lamentations
and did put on
sackcloth and ashes,
saying, Wherefore
should we sit in
darkness?  And why cry our
wares <i>in the</i> shadow?
And because men knew
them, therefore they
heeded them not.
</p>

<p>
5 ¶ But amongst the
<i>young things</i> of the city
there was great rejoicing,
for the mandate, it
was welcome unto them.
</p>

<p>
6 And they said, the
one unto the other, Behold,
it is dark.  Let us,
<i>therefore</i>, advantage
ourselves somewhat.
</p>

<p>
7 ¶ And they did hie
them in pairs unto the
quiet places; verily,
every male did take
with him a female as <i>his</i>
companion, and they
did talk of love.
</p>

<p>
8 And because the
Bishop of that city was
<i>against</i> love, and
because there were many
sojourning there <i>that
did</i> pry, therefore did
the swains speak <i>low</i>,
fearing lest the
eavesdroppers should come
upon them.
</p>

<p>
9 And there were
<i>many</i> that did plight
their troths, because it
was their opportunity;
and many promises
were given in vain.
</p>

<p>
10 ¶ And because it
was dark, women of
strange countenance <i>did</i>
get them off <i>with men</i>,
for a cheek that was fair
as the petals of the
hyssop was <i>of</i> no avail in
the night time.
</p>

<p>
11 Even so, there was
many a woman that did
lose <i>her man</i> ere the
passing of the first
lamp.  And he that was
once bit, on the next
occasion he did carry a
torch in his hand for to
see what <i>it was</i>.
</p>

<p>
12 And if a man <i>did</i>
bump him into his own
wife, he would say
polite things, <i>for</i> he did
not know her;
</p>

<p>
13 And because he
did say polite things,
<i>therefore</i>, neither would
she know him.  And
strange <i>things</i> did
happen because of it.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ Now it came to
pass that a certain man
was returning <i>unto</i> his
habitation at an hour
when the night was far
gone.
</p>

<p>
15 And it was the
custom in that city to
travel in a carriage that
did go in part beneath
the ground; and the
reason thereof was
<i>because it was</i> quick.
</p>

<p>
16 And, behold, as he
proceeded on his way
and was come nigh unto
the place of his abode,
suddenly a great
darkness overcame him so
that he became as one
that is blind.
</p>

<p>
17 And all the people
that were with him in
the carriage were
dismayed and they did rise
upon <i>their</i> feet, and <i>did</i>
mingle, the one with the
other.
</p>

<p>
18 And he that had
authority in <i>that</i>
carriage spake unto them
and commanded them
that they should sit
down.  And they sat
them down.
</p>

<p>
19 And it came to
pass that, after the
young man had sat him
down, behold, his right
hand was taken from
him and it <i>was</i> squeezed.
</p>

<p>
20 And even as he
pondered on this
strange thing that was
happening unto him,
behold, he was bereft of
his left hand also, and it
<i>was</i> squeezed.
</p>

<p>
21 And he was taken
unawares and knew not
what to do, for he was a
young man and
righteous, and <i>he was</i>
married unto a wife.
</p>

<p>
22 Therefore, he sat
him still and did wait
for whatsoever might
come unto him.  And,
lo, presently there <i>was</i> a
kiss given unto him
upon the left cheek;
and, afterwards, was
there a kiss upon his
right cheek also.
</p>

<p>
23 Yea, both upon
the right cheek and
upon the left cheek did
he get him the kisses,
and it <i>was</i> for a long
<i>time</i>.
</p>

<p>
24 And the kisses
that <i>did fall</i> upon his
left cheek were a warming
lot and pleasurable;
and the others, they
were cold.  Therefore
did he turn him about
for to lean towards the
side that <i>was</i> hot.
</p>

<p>
25 And, behold, his
cheeks were seized upon
the instant between two
hands that were soft;
and the one that was
upon his left side did
kiss him with <i>earnestness</i>
upon the mouth so
that he trembled at the
touch.  And because he
was <i>become</i> enamoured
of the pastime, therefore
did he return the kiss
<i>for</i> a long spell.
</p>

<p>
26 And even while it
yet happened, the light
was returned unto the
carriage, and he <i>did</i> see.
</p>

<p>
27 ¶ And, behold,
upon his right hand did
sit a man that was lately
come back from the
wars; and she <i>that was</i>
upon his left hand was
a damsel very comely to
look upon and blushing red.
</p>

<p>
28 And because it
was a mistake, therefore
was he not kissed
<i>again</i> either upon the
right cheek, or upon the
left cheek, or yet upon
the mouth.
</p>

<p>
29 And when he
returned him unto his
house, he did get him
silently <i>unto</i> his
bedchamber.  Neither told
he his wife anything
about it, fearing lest <i>she
would</i> not understand.
</p>

<p>
30 ¶ And concerning
another man, it is
written that he did tie a
piece of white cloth unto
<i>the gate</i> of his house so
that he <i>might</i> know its
whereabouts when the
moon was not high.
</p>

<p>
31 And the small
boys of the neighbourhood
<i>did</i> come and they
took away the piece of
white cloth that was
upon the gate and they
did tie it unto the portal
of an house wherein
there lived a <i>certain</i>
woman, of pleasing
mien and fair to look
upon; and her husband
was gone to the wars.
</p>

<p>
32 And when the
young man returned
unto his habitation,
behold, the piece of cloth
that he did leave, it was
not there; and he <i>was</i>
deceived so that he
entered in unto the wrong
house.
</p>

<p>
33 Nevertheless, the
young man <i>did</i> forgive
the boys of the
neighbourhood for <i>the thing</i>
that they had done unto
him.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now it came to pass
that those who <i>were</i>
in the land of En made
them a custom, and they
did sanctify certain
days of the year unto
charity.
</p>

<p>
2 And the days that
were sanctified they <i>did</i>
call Flag Days.
</p>

<p>
3 Now these are
certain <i>of the</i> Flag Days
that were set aside unto
charity in the land of
En in the days of the
Great War.
</p>

<p>
4 There was Our
Day, and Star and
Garter Day, and Roll of
Honour Day, and Red
Cross Day, and Blue
Cross Day.
</p>

<p>
5 And there was
France's Day, and
Russia's Day, and Serbia's
Day, and Italy's Day,
and Montenegro's Day,
and Roumania's Day,
and Portugal's Day.
</p>

<p>
6 And there were
other Flag Days in
great number so that I,
even I, Artemas, the
scribe, remember not
one half.
</p>

<p>
7 ¶ And on a day that
<i>was</i> a Flag Day the
young maidens of the
cities would gather
themselves together ere
the morning was
weaned, and they would
<i>set out</i>.
</p>

<p>
8 And they would hie
them unto the populous
places of the cities and
they would place
themselves in ambush behind
the corners of the
streets; yea, each one
would take unto herself
a certain corner as her
own, and she <i>would</i> lie
low.
</p>

<p>
9 And when any man
approached nigh unto
the place where she was
hid, then would she
spring out <i>on a sudden</i>
and she <i>would</i> tackle
him.
</p>

<p>
10 ¶ And she would
pin a flag unto his
garment, even unto the
lapel of <i>his</i> coat would
she pin her flag; and
<i>whatsoever</i> money he
did have for to buy him
bread, <i>that</i> would she
take from his pouch for
to pay her, wherefore he
needs did fast.
</p>

<p>
11 And there was no
way of escape open unto
him, for the young girls
of that time were a slim
<i>lot</i> and they <i>knew</i> the
manner of working it.
</p>

<p>
12 And so it came to
pass that, when the
night was come, the
damsels that had sold
them flags were bowed
down beneath a great
weight of gold.  And
the men that <i>had</i> paid,
these were sent empty
away.
</p>

<p>
13 And they returned
unto their habitations,
each man being
wonderfully adorned;
yea, from the crowns of
their heads unto the
<i>turn-up</i> of their nether
garments <i>were they</i> gay
with coloured flags.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ Now there were
certain men that,
seeking to throw dust in the
eyes of the sellers of
flags, did build them
dungeons underneath
the ground, saying, with
a sly look, It will be a
safe place if, perchance,
a Zeppelin <i>cometh</i> nigh.
</p>

<p>
15 Nevertheless, on a
night when the
Zeppelins did hover <i>above
them</i>, then were they on
the roofs of their
habitations with glasses that
did magnify;
</p>

<p>
16 But on the days
that <i>were</i> Flag Days,
then did they betake
themselves stealthily
away and they did hide
in the far corner of the
Zeppelin dungeon that
was deepest down.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ And because
much good flowed from
the Flag Days, and
because the number of
mites that was gathered
in was very great,
therefore <i>did</i> the people
<i>stick</i> them, each man
giving according to his
means.
</p>

<p>
18 Yea, even those
that did retire unto
their Zeppelin cellars
did give to an <i>extent</i>,
for the young girls
followed them thitherwards,
so that there was
no means of escape left
unto them; verily, they
were like unto a spider
<i>that is</i> caught in the
meshes of its own web.
</p>

<p>
19 ¶ Wherefore it
came to pass that when
another nation did join
with the people of En,
and did fight with them
against the men of Hu,
there were some in the
land that did foresee
<i>things</i>, and their hearts
misgave them.
</p>

<p>
20 And when one
spake chidingly unto
them, saying, Why do
ye not rejoice, O men of
little satisfaction?
Behold, there is yet
another that fighteth with
us.  Then would they
make answer and would
say, Assuredly is there
another ally come to
join us.  And there is
<i>also</i> another Flag Day
that bringeth greater
persecution at the
corners of the streets.  And
they were full of
foreboding <i>concerning it</i>.
</p>

<p>
21 But the Flag Days
found favour amongst
the women of the land,
for then was man
delivered into their hands
and <i>they needed</i> not to
spare him.

<p class="intro">
1 <i>The young men go out for

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now in the land of
En the young men
did hurry them away
unto the war, and
amongst the maidens
<i>there were</i> many sad at
heart.
</p>

<p>
2 ¶ And when the
time drew nigh unto a
young man that he must
gird up his loins and go,
then <i>would</i> he speak
unto the damsel of his
choice.
</p>

<p>
3 And he would say
unto her, Thou knowest
that there yet remaineth
unto me only <i>so many</i>
days; let us therefore
arrange matters quickly
that we <i>be</i> married.
</p>

<p>
4 And because the
time was short and <i>it
was</i> her chance, she
would answer and would
say unto him, Thou art
my lord, and whatsoever
thou commandest,
it shall be done.  Let us
therefore hasten <i>about
it</i> lest, peradventure, we
meet with an hindrance
upon the way.
</p>

<p>
5 For the women of
that time <i>were</i> a crafty
lot and they did beguile
their men with soft
words; and the wiles of
Bathsheba, that <i>did</i>
wash herself, were as
nothing <i>in comparison</i>
to these, for they were
full of artfulness.
</p>

<p>
6 And when she had
told her mother and
them <i>that were</i> about
the place, she would
take the young man
unto the priest for to make
<i>them</i> a day; and <i>after</i>
it was in order, then
would they go unto the
ringmaker and she
would try on whatsoever
came unto her
hand.  Yea, <i>many</i> rings
would she place upon
her finger; but <i>the ring</i>
that she did choose, that
did she not try on,
fearing lest it prove
unlucky <i>in the</i> afterwards.
</p>

<p>
7 Now it happened in
certain cases that the
damsel needed not to
furnish her with
garments for the wedding,
inasmuch as she was
prepared, being ready
<i>against the occasion</i>.
</p>

<p>
8 But when it was
not so, then would the
damsel set <i>about</i> it, and
she would make <i>things</i>
hum.  And she and
those that were related
unto her and her
handmaidens also, they
would haste them unto
the bazaars.  And
whatsoever was necessary
unto the marriage, that
thing would they buy;
and <i>of the things</i> that
were not necessary unto
the marriage, they
would also buy them
some of these.
</p>

<p>
9 And when the last
minute was come, then
would they send the <i>old</i>
man for to buy that
<i>which</i> was forgotten,
saying unto him, Get
thee quickly, <i>thou</i> fool.
And he <i>would</i> get him
quickly.
</p>

<p>
10 And when the
hour was come for the
young man to take the
damsel unto him,
behold, she <i>was</i> there.
And throughout all the
land of En there was no
case known of a damsel
that <i>did come</i> too late.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ And because
there <i>was</i> a great
number of them that did
wed in this wise,
therefore was there much
talk <i>concerning</i> it, both
in the public places and
in the habitations of the
people.
</p>

<p>
12 And some <i>did</i> say
it was a foolish thing to
do.  And they did speak
darkly concerning the
future, what it did hide,
for it went <i>for a saying</i>
amongst them that a
marriage <i>that</i> is hasty
bringeth early regret.
</p>

<p>
13 And others said,
Let the young men wed.
Verily, many go forth
unto the wars but the
number <i>of them</i> that
return, it is not so great.
Therefore is it necessary
for them that are <i>of an
age</i> to make <i>them</i>
families, else in what
manner shall the nation endure.
</p>

<p>
14 And the young
things heeded not these
arguments, for they
<i>were</i> young and did
love.  And whosoever
loveth <i>enough</i>, he hath
his justification.
</p>

<p>
15 But woe unto that
man who taketh unto
himself a wife for the
sake <i>of it</i>; a million
tears will not suffice for
to drown <i>her</i> in.
</p>

<p>
16 But he that
marrieth his beloved in
haste, seeking happiness,
that man assuredly
<i>hath</i> a dog's chance;
and he that taketh time
<i>about</i> the business, is
not his risk also great?
</p>

<p>
17 And there <i>were</i>
some that did marry for
love and there <i>were</i>
some that did marry for
a pension; but there
<i>were</i> some that did
marry because it was a
discreet thing to do.
</p>

<p>
18 And the number
of them that did marry
was <i>beyond</i> anything
that men could remember,
so that the priests
did gather them an harvest
of <i>exceeding</i> richness
and they did bless
the unions with many
pious <i>words</i>.
</p>

<p>
19 ¶ Now certain men
did take unto
themselves more wives than
one, which <i>was</i> a wicked
thing to do, for in the
land of En it was not
lawful <i>for a man</i> to
marry two wives.
</p>

<p>
20 And this was passing
strange, for the
seduction of a maiden was
a thing that was <i>winked
at</i>.  Yea, the father of a
child begotten guiltily,
he was absolved by the
payment of five pieces
of silver every week.
But the man whose wife
did bear him a son, his
<i>punishment</i> was greater
than this.
</p>

<p>
21 And in those days
was man judged <i>according
to</i> a rule, and an
hurt transgressing not
the rule, that was
forgiven unto him.  And
to marry two wives,
<i>that was</i> against the
rule; but to keep two
score of concubines,
<i>that was</i> a lawful thing
to do.
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ And because
there was war, therefore
did many mothers
<i>pull off</i> forlorn hopes at
the last minute, which
rejoiced them greatly.
For there <i>was</i> much
competition amongst the
daughters of En, and
<i>the number</i> of young
men did not suffice for all.
</p>

<p>
23 ¶ And every maiden
did seek for <i>to get</i>
her an officer, for <i>these
were</i> great men whom
the common soldiers did
salute in the public
places, so that to walk
with such an one <i>was</i>
indeed pleasurable.
</p>

<p>
24 And there was
much cackling in all the
hen-roosts of the land of
En, and <i>amongst those</i>
families that did get
them an officer there
were loud manifestations
of joy.
</p>

<p>
25 And the pride of
these was <i>beyond</i> all
telling, and they <i>would</i>
hold up their heads on
high and they <i>would</i>
say unto them that did
live next door, Bow ye
down before us and
make obeisance.  Know
ye not that Miriam, our
first-born, <i>hath</i> taken a
captain to husband?
</p>

<p>
26 And because they
<i>did</i> know <i>it</i> and because
<i>their</i> daughter had
succeeded only as high as a
corporal of the lance,
they would bow
themselves down and would
speak words of flattery,
for she that was <i>wife</i>
unto a captain was a
power in the confines of
<i>the</i> cities.
</p>

<p>
27 But there <i>were</i>
many maidens that no
man took unto him for
wife, and the days of
these were bitter living;
neither did their sisters
that had <i>clicked</i> refrain
from telling them <i>about it</i>.
</p>

<p>
28 Wherefore some of
the damsels <i>that were
left over</i> did journey
into the wilderness for to
meditate concerning the
matter, for the airs of a
woman that is married
are <i>as</i> a goad unto her
that languisheth alone.
</p>

<p>
29 And so it came to
pass that certain <i>of
them</i> did get them war
work from the makers of
munitions, and certain
<i>of them</i> did get them
war babies from no man
knew whither.  Yea,
every one did act
according to her lights and
<i>did</i> do all those things
that the occasion did
demand.

CHAPTER XII.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Concerning those that
went not forth for to fight</i>.
14 <i>The rulers commune
together on the matter</i>.  17
<i>And call out all the young
men</i>.  18 <i>But certain are
absolved</i>.  25 <i>Wherefore
many are combed out</i>.  29
<i>And the people are
satisfied</i>.  31 <i>Each man
payeth for his own strong
drink</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
And when the fighters
had gone forth unto
the war, there yet
remained <i>certain men</i> that
were strong and sound
of limb.  And every man
that went not forth, <i>he
had</i> his reason.
</p>

<p>
2 And some said, To
kill men in battle is a
wicked <i>thing</i>.  Would ye
therefore have us <i>to go</i>
against our consciences?
</p>

<p>
3 And when the people
questioned these,
they replied unto them,
saying, The wise man
giveth obedience unto
his conscience lest it
torment him; neither <i>is
there</i> any escape from
it.  And we are men of
wisdom.
</p>

<p>
4 And if one of the
men of Hu shall ravish
our eldest daughter,
<i>then</i> shall we offer unto
him she <i>that</i> is next
unto her that he may ravish
her also; for so it is
written.
</p>

<p>
5 And they that
questioned them forbore to
ask them more, deeming
a conscience <i>such as
this</i> was assuredly come
from the devil.
</p>

<p>
6 And there were
some that, being
affrighted, hid themselves
away.  And the number
<i>of these</i> was small and,
when <i>the time</i> came,
they were <i>combed</i> out.
</p>

<p>
7 And there were
others that were grown
selfish, because they <i>did</i>
gain much recompense
by their labours, and
these were loth to leave
their habitations.  And
they did say,
</p>

<p>
8 Wherefore should
we go forth for to fight?
In our houses <i>there are</i>
many fires and the
women do put them hot
bricks into our beds <i>so
that</i> our feet suffer not
when the night groweth
cold.
</p>

<p>
9 And if we go out
for to fight, verily, the
rain from heaven will
fall upon us and it will
<i>make</i> us wet.  And a
skin <i>that</i> is wet
affecteth the nose.
</p>

<p>
10 And the food that
we shall eat, it will lie
<i>heavy</i> upon our stomachs;
neither will the
women sustain us with
hot bricks.
</p>

<p>
11 And because of all
these things, they went
not forth unto the war
<i>until</i> the time came
when they were <i>combed</i>
out.
</p>

<p>
12 And there were
many men throughout
the land that were
willing to go at <i>the time</i>
appointed, each <i>man</i> in his
turn.
</p>

<p>
13 And these did say,
"Wherefore should we
depart from our
habitations and wherefore
leave our wives amongst
strange people?  Send
first the young men <i>that
are</i> hanging back; and,
afterwards, when our
time <i>cometh</i>, we shall be
ready.  And ye shall find
us in the forefront of
the battle.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ And because that
which they had said was
just, therefore the
rulers of the land could
not gainsay them.  And
they communed together
in the council chamber
<i>concerning it</i>.
</p>

<p>
15 And some, knowing
not <i>the spirit</i> of the
people, did say, Let us
now do nothing rash
lest, if we call up all the
young men, they raise
an outcry throughout
the land.
</p>

<p>
16 But there were
others that said, <i>It is</i>
sufficient that we have
need of men for to send
against the enemy.  Let
us therefore <i>see about it</i>.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ And they
overruled those that <i>were</i>
against them, and did
make them a law
whereby all the young men
were called out for to
fight.
</p>

<p>
18 ¶ But they
absolved them that were
in the workshops
making the munitions of
war, and acquitted them
also <i>that were</i> plagued
with a conscience.
</p>

<p>
19 And because the
men of Ire said, We will
not <i>have</i> it, therefore
the rulers dared not to
say <i>them</i> nay, for the
men of Ire were rulers
in the land of En.
</p>

<p>
20 And they appointed
them tribunals, a
mixed lot of men, so that
<i>those</i> that were called
out might show them a
<i>reason</i> against it.
</p>

<p>
21 And because the
net that was spread in
the sight of the young
men was wide <i>in the</i>
mesh, therefore was the
haul thereof fraught
with disappointment.
And the young men did
work themselves free in
ways that <i>were</i> various.
</p>

<p>
22 And some hied
them unto the workshops
to become makers
of munitions of war,
saying, the one unto the
other, <i>By this means</i>,
assuredly, shall we save
our skins.  And for a
long time <i>it was</i> so.
</p>

<p>
23 And others did cry
their woes before the
tribunals.  And <i>the tales</i>
that they did tell were
pitiful indeed, and they
did move the tribunals
unto compassion <i>so that</i>
they absolved them.
</p>

<p>
24 And the rulers, that
did <i>ought</i> to set an
example, made lusty
youths for to be their
scribes, and they did
put them for to do
women's work.  And the
number <i>of them</i> that
were absolved in this
wise became a crying
shame that was <i>heard</i>
throughout all the land.
</p>

<p>
25 ¶ And when the
rulers were questioned
hotly <i>concerning</i> these
men and <i>concerning</i>
those that had hidden
themselves behind the
rampart that <i>was</i>
munitions, they bestirred
themselves somewhat
and did <i>comb</i> them out.
</p>

<p>
26 And the number
that they did <i>comb</i> out
was very great.  And
because they had not done
<i>this thing</i> before, but
had waited until the
people raised them a
clamour, therefore were
the rulers blamed exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
27 Nevertheless, those
that rebelled against it
because they did have
consciences, <i>these</i> were
not sent out for to fight.
</p>

<p>
28 But some of them
were set to work upon
<i>matters of health</i>, which
was a loathsome duty
and abhorred by them
who, <i>being</i> without a
conscience, went out
against the enemy.
</p>

<p>
29 ¶ And when all
the men that <i>were</i> of
full vigour had been
<i>taken</i>, there was an end
to the murmuring of the
people.
</p>

<p>
30 And all were of
one mind that this
thing should have been
done before, for they
saw that the taking was
just, no man suffering
beyond his neighbour,
and every man fighting
for his own.
</p>

<p>
31 ¶ Now it was made
a law that whosoever
should enter into a
tavern for to buy him
strong drink, that man
must pay for <i>his own</i>.
</p>

<p>
32 And there were
some, being them that
drank beyond their
means, that had a grievance
<i>because</i> of it, for to
pay for <i>their own</i>, they
had forgotten the way.
</p>

<p>
33 Wherefore they did
suffer exceedingly and
<i>were</i> for ever dry; and
<i>their</i> look, it was a
thirsty one.
</p>

<p>
34 And when <i>the damsels</i>
heard about it, they
set them out for to find
<i>a means</i> to circumvent
it, for the thing was not
agreeable unto them.
</p>

<p>
35 And when a maiden
approached unto a
tavern, being with a
man that had a leaning
<i>towards</i> her, then would
she stop outside, and
she would say unto him,
Give thou unto me five
pieces of silver that I
may pay for <i>mine own</i>.
And whatsoever remaineth
over, that will I give
thee back after <i>we are</i>
come out.
</p>

<p>
36 And they would
enter into a tavern.  And
she would call the
serving man unto her and
she would speak unto
him in a soft voice,
saying, Bring unto me a
small portion of <i>that</i>
wine which cometh from
Oporto that I may
nourish my bones.
</p>

<p>
37 And the serving
man would bring it unto
her, and he would set it
down before her.  And
the damsel <i>would</i> pay
for it out of the five
pieces of silver that she
had received from her
man.  And whatsoever
was left over, <i>that</i> would
she place in her purse.
</p>

<p>
38 And <i>afterwards</i>, she
would smile upon the
man that was with her,
and she would say unto
him, Thy beard becometh
thee well.  Thou art
strong and thy wisdom
is great and thine eyes
absorb me <i>utterly</i>.  Verily
doth thine handmaiden
feel small in the sight
of her lord.
</p>

<p>
39 All this would she
say unto him, and more
also; but concerning
<i>that which</i> was remaining
over from the five
pieces of silver she
would say no word.
</p>

<p>
40 And this is ever
the way of women that
by their artfulness they
do <i>wangle it</i>, and
whatsoever cometh up
<i>contrary</i>, that do they work
for to be an advantage
unto them.

CHAPTER XIII.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Concerning David</i>.  7 <i>His
unpopularity amongst
certain of the people</i>.  9 <i>The
rulers disagree</i>.  11 <i>David
speaketh out</i>.  14 <i>He
findeth favour with his
enemies</i>.  17 <i>The things that
he did do</i>.  24 <i>He reacheth
unto high office</i>.  27
<i>The Pharisees fall away
from him</i>.  29 <i>His greatness</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now there was a
certain man and his
name was David, and
his place <i>was</i> amongst
the rulers of the land of
En.
</p>

<p>
2 Though small of
stature, yet was he of a
fiery spirit, and the hair
upon his face was <i>as</i>
the bristles of a badger
<i>that is</i> roused.
</p>

<p>
3 And his tongue was
for ever loose and did
wag itself continually,
being like unto the tail
of a small dog that
scenteth its food <i>from</i>
afar.
</p>

<p>
4 Now David was one
of them that <i>did</i> come
from the land of Cam,
but the language of his
kindred did he speak
only upon occasion;
</p>

<p>
5 And at other <i>times</i>
he did speak as the men
of En, save only when
he delivered him a
warning unto them that
would <i>butt</i> in; and in
such case his words were
those of the land of
Amer.
</p>

<p>
6 Now at the time
when Willi did lead out
his hosts for to fight,
David <i>was</i> the chief tax
gatherer in the land of En.
</p>

<p>
7 ¶ And his name was
an abomination throughout
the land.  Men cursed
him in the market
places, in the sight of
the publicans he was a
thing unclean, and <i>his</i>
name stank vilely in the
nostrils of the priests.
</p>

<p>
8 Verily, to love En
and David both, was not
thought possible by
many.  Only amongst the
Pharisees was it not so,
and <i>these men</i> of little
mind did glorify him
with a great praise.
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ Now it came to
pass when the rulers of
the land of En took
counsel, the one with the
other, concerning
whether they should <i>make</i>
them a war, there were
some that did say, Let
us make a war, for an
honourable pledge
<i>demandeth</i> fulfilment;
nought can absolve a
nation from <i>its</i> plighted
word, and we are <i>what</i>
we are.
</p>

<p>
10 And there were
others <i>that were</i> the
Pharisees, and they did
say, Why hasten ye
towards the shedding of
men's blood?  Better a
peace that obeyeth
divine precept than a war
<i>that</i> upholdeth the word
of a nation.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ And when David
heard the things that
the Pharisees did say,
behold, he arose from
his seat in the council
chamber and spake
unto all <i>them</i> that were
there.
</p>

<p>
12 And he lashed the
Pharisees with his
tongue, sparing them
not.  And because he
was <i>of</i> them, therefore
were the words that he
did say unto them passing
apt, so that they <i>did</i>
wriggle in their seats
as worms <i>that are</i> upon
an hot plate.
</p>

<p>
13 And them that
would preserve the
nation's honour at a cost
<i>of</i> blood, these did he
sustain with the
strength of his doings
and the whole might of
<i>his</i> oratory.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ And <i>when</i> the
publicans and the
priests and those that
had cursed him in the
market places were told
what he had <i>done</i>, they
were amazed that such a
thing could come to
pass.
</p>

<p>
15 And they said
unto each other, What
manner of man is this
that hath for so long
<i>been</i> against us, yet now
speaketh our very
minds?
</p>

<p>
16 And they raised
him up and made him
<i>to be</i> ruler over them,
and he did find more
favour amongst those
people than he had
found amongst the
Pharisees in the time
that <i>was</i> gone.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ And it came to
pass that whatsoever
<i>there was</i> to be done,
that thing did David
do; verily, his capacities
were as manifold as
the lies of a woman accused.
</p>

<p>
18 And they made
him chief over the
munitioners, and he did
make him engines of
war and instruments of
siege, and other implements
of battle <i>also</i>, the
quantity whereof
exceeded calculation.
</p>

<p>
19 And nobody
throughout all the land
excelled him in energy
and in ingenuity of the
mind.  And he did even
make the workers to
work; and this <i>was</i> a
thing that was never
<i>before</i> known in the
land of En.
</p>

<p>
20 And when the men
of Ire, <i>because</i> they
were never content,
waxed angry, the one
with the other, and
there was like to be
rebellion amongst them,
and there <i>was</i> need of a
mediator for to judge
between them,
</p>

<p>
21 Then the choice of
the people fell upon
David, and they did
send him unto the land
of Ire for to speak the
soft word <i>that</i> charmeth
away wrath.
</p>

<p>
22 And David went.
And after he had finished
speaking unto the
men of Ire, he returned
him unto his seat
amongst the rulers.
</p>

<p>
23 And because <i>he
was</i> the first man that
did go for to pacify the
men of Ire, yet stirred
not up further strife,
therefore was his name
honoured above any,
and poets did sing his
praises on the feast days
<i>of the</i> Eisteddfod.
</p>

<p>
24 If And the rulers
did choose him to
succeed unto a great
soldier, and they did place
him over the hosts of
En, making of him a
mighty captain.  And
<i>because</i> the people
would have none other,
therefore was he chosen.
</p>

<p>
25 And the work that
was <i>already</i> begun, that
did he continue.  And
he did make the hosts of
En great beyond all
conception, and the
strength of En was as
the foundations of the
earth.
</p>

<p>
26 And his popularity
with the people did
grow day by day, wherefore
men said, in jest,
Behold, here <i>cometh</i>
David, George that is
the Sixth.  And they
that had hated him
before did worship him as
a god.
</p>

<p>
27 ¶ But the Pharisees
knew not what to
do, for he was become as
a revelation unto them.
Therefore did they say
very little <i>concerning</i>
him; and when it
happened that they had
occasion to utter his name,
then would they do so
<i>with</i> a sniff <i>upon</i> the
word.
</p>

<p>
28 For <i>such is</i> the
way of the Pharisees.
And these do place
peace above the honour
of a nation and an
unctuous word before the
doing of a thing that is
right.  And in them
there is no stomach for
the fray.
</p>

<p>
29 ¶ But David cared
not at all for such as
these, and there was no
man greater in all the
land.  And when <i>the
time</i> came, he did sit
upon the highest seat
amongst the rulers of
the land, because he was
the chosen of the people,
and they would have
none other.

<p>
2 Now there were
guns of great magnitude
that <i>did</i> hit hard so that
there was nothing that
could withstand them,
and, against them, the
fortifications of the
cities <i>were</i> as snow when

his death, it <i>was</i> terrible.
</p>

<p>
6 And they that first
made use of the gas that
was poison <i>were</i> the men
of Hu, for it was <i>in
them</i> to do so because
their minds did travel
unto such things.
</p>

<p>
7 And there was
liquid that <i>was</i> fire, and
it was sent against an
host for to burn up the
flesh <i>of them</i> that came
in the way.  And this
was also <i>from</i> the men
of Hu and was bred of
their refinement.  And
neither of these things
did the nations of Eur
use in any war that they
did wage <i>before</i>.
</p>

<p>
8 ¶ And there were
engines that did fly
through the air,
fearsome weapons of war
that <i>did</i> deal out death
and destruction from an
ambush of clouds.
</p>

<p>
9 And they were of
two kinds.  And the
Zeps <i>were</i> fat-bellied,
being of the men of Hu.
</p>

<p>
10 These did carry on
their goings out a great
weight of <i>matter</i> that
<i>was</i> death.  And they
did drop it <i>at a venture</i>
so that it fell amongst
peaceful dwellers in the
land; and the women
and children that did
perish by this means, it
<i>was</i> a great number.
</p>

<p>
11 And there were
also engines that did fly
which men called
planes: and <i>these</i> were
of both sides.  And they
were speedy things <i>and</i>
nimble.
</p>

<p>
12 And those that did
ride in them were brave
men and skilful.  And
the men of Hu
prospered not with the
planes save only <i>in the</i>
flight, at which they
were exceeding quick.
</p>

<p>
13 And so there came
a time when the men of
Hu forbore to go up
into the air for to fight
<i>because</i> the hazard of such
an enterprise, it was
very great.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ Now the bravery
of the warriors of En
that did ride in the
planes was in the
mouths of all the
peoples <i>of</i> the earth.  And
there was one whom
men <i>did call</i> the Mad
Major because of his
daring.
</p>

<p>
15 And it was said
concerning him that he
and death played them
a long game wherein the
dice were loaded on <i>the
side</i> of death.
</p>

<p>
16 And he would venture
forth and would fly
from the camp of the
men of En until he
came unto a place
whence he could see the
hosts of Hu <i>spread out</i>
beneath him.
</p>

<p>
17 Then would he
choose him a target
from amongst the strong
<i>places</i> that were below,
and he would swoop him
down <i>on a sudden</i> so
that he was but a few
cubits on high.
</p>

<p>
18 And the men of
Hu would use <i>all</i>
manner of weapons against
him, and they would
send projectiles that did
scatter <i>about</i> for to
bring him down
amongst them.
</p>

<p>
19 Yea, from the
places that <i>were</i> nigh
unto him and from the
places that <i>were</i> afar off
would they send of their
munition, seeking only
that they might slay
him.  And the heavens
were filled with a
multitude of balls so that
men said, Verily, in the
place <i>where</i> he is, in
that place only is it
possible for man to live.
</p>

<p>
20 And when he that
was called the Mad
Major was <i>low enough</i>,
then would he drop him
a bomb.  And it came to
pass that all that which
was <i>underneath</i>, it was
destroyed, and the men
that <i>were</i> there did
assuredly perish.
</p>

<p>
21 Then would he
ascend into the air unto
a certain height, for that
which he had come for
to do, <i>it was</i> done.
</p>

<p>
22 And he would loop
him <i>a loop</i>; yea, even
over the hosts of Hu
would he loop him <i>a
loop</i>, for he was of a
merry spirit and it was
<i>in him</i> to laugh in this
manner.
</p>

<p>
23 And when he had
looped him <i>a loop</i> he
would return unto the
men of En, and he
<i>would</i> say unto them,
The bombs that thou
gavest unto me <i>went</i> off.
Give me, therefore,
some more that I may
dispose <i>of them</i> in likewise.
</p>

<p>
24 And he was not
alone in the things that
he did do, for there
<i>were</i> many like unto
him.  And concerning
the deeds of some thou
shalt find it writ in the
books; but concerning
many, thou shalt find no
record of <i>their</i> deeds in
the chronicles of that
time.
</p>

<p>
25 ¶ And the men of
En did make them
chariots of strange and
wonderful design, and
they <i>did</i> call them tanks.
And there was no man
throughout all the land
that did say, I made not
this chariot; but every
man did draw his neighbour
<i>unto the side</i>, and
did speak unto him privily,
saying, Shush!  Let
it not be known.  I tell
thee that I, even I, did
take <i>an hand</i> in this
thing.
</p>

<p>
26 And the shape of
the tanks was for a long
time known only to the
few.  And some said
they were <i>like unto</i> a
lizard that is blown out
mightily, that walketh
as a man plagued with
<i>the</i> corns.
</p>

<p>
27 And others said
they were <i>like unto</i> an
hippopotamus that doth
wobble itself amazingly
so that no man knoweth
whither it intendeth;
yet, <i>of a certainty</i>, doth
it get there.
</p>

<p>
28 And others said
they were <i>like unto</i>
nothing on earth, being
for the most part belly
of a fashion <i>that is</i>
given unto no living thing.
</p>

<p>
29 And that <i>which</i>
was a shield and a
covering unto the tanks was
tough past all belief;
yea, even the hide of the
rhinoceros did not
compare unto this.  And all
the missiles that the men
of Hu did send <i>against</i>
it were as peas upon a
roof that is whole, and it
availed them nothing.
</p>

<p>
30 And in its gait it
was like unto a man that
hath taken strong drink,
having first devoured
much rice.  For in such
case does the belly grow
big and the footsteps do
<i>become</i> unsteady.
Wherefore it was a
thing <i>for</i> laughter
amongst the men of En;
but in the hosts of
Hu it was a thing <i>for</i>
fear.
</p>

<p>
31 And men told
strange tales of the
<i>things</i> that it did do.
And it was said that
upon an occasion it did
sally forth and, in its
adventuring, it did meet
with an habitation.
</p>

<p>
32 And it did go up
unto the habitation and
it <i>did</i> look upon it.  And
it did go <i>against</i> the
habitation <i>with a
purpose</i> so that the walls
did fall about it and
there was ruination on
all sides.
</p>

<p>
33 And after it had
shaken itself free from
all that <i>which</i> had fallen
upon it, it did betake
itself with modesty unto
another place as a man
that is overcome with
shyness and seeketh to
<i>pass it over</i>.  Verily, it
recked <i>nothing</i> of the
thing that it had done.
</p>

<p>
34 ¶ Wherefore, and
because it did smite
them hip and thigh,
sparing not any man
that did come up
against it, the men of
Hu <i>were</i> afraid, and
they did cry out with
loud lamentations,
saying, Why do ye so
despitefully <i>use</i> us?  Know
ye not that it is not <i>in
the war</i> to do these
things?
</p>

<p>
35 And because men
<i>knew</i> them, they heeded
not their groans, so that
it availed them nothing;
and the tank remained a
thing of terror throughout
all their hosts.
</p>

<p>
36 And in this thing
the men of En <i>were</i> first
amongst all the fighters
of Eur, for <i>it was</i> new.
And the people rejoiced,
being satisfied that it
was given unto them as
a sign that the rulers
were <i>becoming</i> awake.

CHAPTER XV.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Concerning the land of
Amer</i>.  4 <i>And the ruler
thereof</i>.  11 <i>Certain men
of Amer are slain</i>.  12
<i>Wudro, the son of Wyl,
writeth an epistle</i>.  26 <i>He
writeth again</i>.  27 <i>He
writeth many times</i>.  28
<i>Certain men do question
him</i>.  38 <i>He revealeth himself</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now the land of
Amer was at the
other side of the sea
<i>that is</i> Atlantic, and it
was many days' sail in
a ship from the island
of En.
</p>

<p>
2 And the bounds of
that land were set far
apart, and the people
that did live there were
more numerous than the
waves of all the seas.
</p>

<p>
3 And it was a fertile
land of extreme
fruitfulness, and the earth
<i>underneath</i> it yielded
precious metals in
abundance.  And the people
were for ever extolling
its greatness <i>amongst</i>
the nations of the earth.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ Now the ruler of
the land of Amer was a
certain man and his
name was Wudro, the
son of Wyl; and it
happened <i>in this wise</i>.
</p>

<p>
5 Whilst Wudro, the
son of Wyl, was tending
his flock of young men
in the pasture <i>that is</i>
knowledge, and after he
had taught them how
they should go and what
things they should know,
</p>

<p>
6 Behold, the men of
Amer came unto him,
saying, We have chosen
thee for to rule over us;
and we have <i>brought</i>
thee an high hat for to
wear as the badge of
thine office; and the size
of the hat, <i>it is</i> six
seven-eighths.
</p>

<p>
7 And because he
knew not what he was
letting himself <i>in for</i>, he
gave way to their
importuning, and did put on
the high hat, the <i>size</i>
whereof was six seven-eighths.
</p>

<p>
8 And it came to pass
that when the men of
En fought against the
men of Hu, they did
send messengers unto
the land of Amer for to
buy them munitions for
the war.  And they took
<i>with them</i> gold in great
quantity wherewith to
satisfy the merchants
that did sell unto them.
Therefore did the land
of Amer prosper exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
9 Now when the men
of Hu found out that
<i>there was</i> peril in the
enterprise, they forbore
to send out vessels of
war for to fight; in place
thereof, they did send
them out for to murder
those that <i>were</i> peaceful
and did <i>sail</i> the seas
without any weapon
<i>wherewith</i> to defend
themselves.
</p>

<p>
10 And coming upon
a large ship unawares,
they did send it unto the
bottom of the sea so that
all <i>they</i> that did travel
upon it were cast into
the waters for to drown.
Yea, even the women
and children that were
aboard the vessel, all
these perished miserably,
and the men of
Hu did watch their
struggles with death
unheeding.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ Now amongst
those that the men of
Hu did slay there were
<i>certain</i> men of the land
of Amer.
</p>

<p>
12 ¶ And when word
was brought unto
Wudro, the son of Wyl,
<i>concerning</i> it, and how
the men of Hu had
slain his servants, he
waxed very wroth.  And
he betook himself unto
a quiet place, <i>fearing
lest</i> in the height of his
indignation he should do
violence unto <i>any</i> man.
</p>

<p>
13 And although he
was enraged <i>beyond</i>
endurance, nevertheless he
was a patient man withal.
</p>

<p>
14 Therefore he did
sit him down <i>and</i> he did
write an epistle unto
Willi, being him that
ruled over <i>the men</i> of
Hu.
</p>

<p>
15 And he said <i>unto
him</i>, Knowest thou not
that thy servants have
slain certain of the men
of Amer <i>because</i> they
did sail upon the sea?
</p>

<p>
16 And Willi answered
him, saying,
Verily, all that thou sayest
<i>is</i> true.  Let us therefore
put on sackcloth
and ashes, and rend our
garments, for it is <i>a day</i>
of mourning unto thee,
and I, <i>also</i>, am full of
sorrow because of it.
</p>

<p>
17 And when Wudro,
the son of Wyl, heard
all that Willi had said,
and how he made
answer unto him in soft
<i>words</i>, he knew not
what to do, for <i>he was</i>
a peaceable man <i>and</i> the
land of Amer was
prospering greatly.
</p>

<p>
18 So he sat him
down and did write
unto Willi again, saying
unto him, Thy tears <i>are
as</i> an healing ointment.
But <i>the thing</i> that thou
hast done, that shalt
thou do not again, <i>for</i>
there is a penalty unto
it.  Take heed, therefore,
and obey, for I am
a terrible man, and
fierce.
</p>

<p>
19 And Willi answered
him and did say,
Thou <i>hast</i> said so and
so, for I have <i>seen</i> it
with mine own eyes.
Let us now speak
<i>concerning</i> other matters.
</p>

<p>
20 And he called unto
him a messenger and did
command him to deliver
the epistle unto the
ruler of the land of
Amer.
</p>

<p>
21 And after he was
gone, he set to work
secretly and did <i>make</i>
him preparation, for it
was his intendment to
do again <i>that thing</i>
regarding which Wudro,
the son of Wyl, had
forewarned him.
</p>

<p>
22 And when the
opportunity came, he did
sink more ships, and he
did leave those that were
<i>on them</i> to perish.  And
because they were all
vessels of peace, and
without armour,
therefore was he strong
<i>against them</i>.
</p>

<p>
23 And a messenger
came unto Wudro, the
son of Wyl, in hot haste,
and he told him of the
things that Willi had
done and <i>how that</i> he
had slain yet more of
the men of Amer.
</p>

<p>
24 And <i>because</i> he
was much agitated at
the tidings that were
brought unto him, <i>therefore</i>
did Wudro, the son
of Wyl, swear an oath,
making divers new
<i>words</i> for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
25 And he said unto
the courier, The matter
<i>concerning which</i> thou
hast spoken unto me is
fraught with evil
consequences, for I will write
unto Willi another
epistle, and I will use
mighty words, and I
<i>will</i> affright him.  Also,
there shall be <i>an afterwards</i>.
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ So he sat him
down and did write unto
Willi another epistle;
and the words <i>of it</i> were
so terrifying that the
hand of his scribe <i>did</i>
tremble even in the
putting of it down.
</p>

<p>
27 ¶ And for a long
time it came to pass that
whenever Willi did slay
any of the men of Amer,
<i>then</i> did Wudro, the son
of Wyl, send an epistle
unto him, abounding in
fearsome words and writ
upon one <i>side</i> of the paper only.
</p>

<p>
28 ¶ And certain
men, <i>being</i> of a curious
mind, questioned him,
saying, It is true that
the epistles that thou
writest are things <i>for</i>
terror, and that <i>the man</i>
who reads them, his
blood becometh frozen so
that it circulateth not.
</p>

<p>
29 And it is true,
also, that the things
which thou threatenest
<i>are</i> dire.  But the
<i>things</i> that thou doest,
what are they?  Is it not
an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth?  Yet
thou hast sold our lives
<i>for</i> gold.  Thy threats
are idle, and thy words
serve but to tickle, not
to scratch.
</p>

<p>
30 And Wudro, the
son of Wyl, <i>having</i>
knowledge, did reason
with them.  And he
spake unto them in these
words, <i>saying</i>: What
mean ye?  Are not the
epistles to your liking?
Are not my words
strong <i>and</i> well chosen,
and is not my meaning
plain to all?
</p>

<p>
31 And they
answered him, saying,
Verily, these things are
so.  Have we not said it?
Nevertheless, the man
that is wounded by a
word, he <i>sheweth</i> no
scar.  <i>How then</i> is the
marksman to know?
</p>

<p>
32 And hast thou not
perceived that Willi
laughs at thee before
thy face; and, <i>behind</i>
thy back, he doth
extend his fingers towards
thee, pointing them
<i>from</i> the apex of his
nostrils.
</p>

<p>
33 At thy threats
doth he scoff aloud, and
thy servants doth he use
<i>in a manner</i> that is
abominable.
</p>

<p>
34 If these things
find not favour in thine
eyes, send forth thine
hosts that he may know
that <i>there is</i> might
behind thy write.
</p>

<p>
35 And Wudro, the
son of Wyl, did loose
his tongue <i>upon them</i>
and he upbraided them,
soundly, saying, Am I a
fool and a blind man
<i>that</i> rule over you?
</p>

<p>
36 Wherefore, then,
should ye upbraid me,
and who are ye to choose
<i>the time</i>?  Verily, I say
<i>unto you</i> that a lack of
understanding, it
shineth from your eyes.
And your words, they
are wanting <i>of</i> any wisdom.
</p>

<p>
37 But I am trusted
of my people; neither
shall I betray that trust
<i>because</i> of your
importuning.  And when he
had spoken unto them in
this wise, he sent them
away.  And he satisfied
<i>them</i> not on that day.

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now the longest rope,
<i>it hath</i> an end.
Wherefore it came to
pass <i>in time</i> that
Wudro, the son of Wyl,
did send unto Willi,
that was the King of
the Hu, and he said
unto him,
</p>

<p>
2 Such things and
such things hast thou
done, <i>all these</i> being
against thy plighted
word; and thine iniquity,
it hath tormented
me for a long <i>time</i> past.
Now, therefore, hearken
unto me, <i>and</i> pay attention:
</p>

<p>
3 Because I am a
man of peace, therefore
have I borne with thee
long <i>enough</i>; and I am
become sick unto death
<i>with</i> thy carryings <i>on</i>.
And the blood of my
murdered people, it
crieth out for retribution.
</p>

<p>
4 Take heed, <i>therefore</i>,
and mend the evil
of thy ways, for, <i>on the</i>
next occasion, assuredly
shalt thou rue the day.
</p>

<p>
5 And when Willi
had heard <i>these</i> things
that Wudro, the son of
Wyl, did say unto him,
he sent in haste unto his
chief captains, and he
did commune <i>with them</i>.
</p>

<p>
6 And he questioned
them closely concerning
the words of Wudro.
And he said unto them,
Think ye that this man,
he meaneth <i>anything</i>?
</p>

<p>
7 And they made
answer unto him,
saying, Be of good cheer
and heed him not, for
he is a man that acteth
only <i>according to</i> his
advantage.  And to
make war, it would
advantage him nothing.
For the land of Amer,
it prospereth exceedingly;
and the miller turneth
not away <i>that
stream</i> which worketh
his wheel.
</p>

<p>
8 Also, he liveth
afar off and his servants,
<i>they are</i> unready.
Verily, the threats of
such an one, they be
full of emptiness; and
whatsoever he sayeth,
that hath he <i>also</i> said
before.  <i>Nevertheless</i>,
we will smite him
<i>because</i> of it when the
time is ripe.
</p>

<p>
9 And after Willi
had heard all the things
that the captains of his
host did say unto him,
his heart was rejoiced
<i>within</i> him, and he said
unto them, Assuredly
are ye men after mine
own understanding.
Let us, therefore, see
<i>about</i> it.  And they did
see <i>about</i> it.
</p>

<p>
10 And when word
was brought unto
Wudro concerning these
things and how Willi
<i>did</i> set his warning at
naught, making mock of
his threats, then was he
very wroth, and he cried
out in the violence of
his anger, saying, Am I,
then, Job, <i>that be</i> born
again, to be tormented
thus?
</p>

<p>
11 And he <i>straightway</i>
called the people
unto him, and he spake
unto them.  And after
he had told them
<i>everything</i>, he said unto
them, Is it, therefore, a
<i>matter for</i> war?  And
they answered him with
a mighty voice, saying,
It is a <i>matter for</i> war.
</p>

<p>
12 And when Willi
heard what was come to
pass, <i>he was</i> amazed,
and his knees, they did
tremble beneath him.
And he commanded his
servants that they
should bring unto him
the brazen mask, being
part of the royal attire;
and <i>he did</i> put it on.
</p>

<p>
13 And after that it
was <i>on</i>, he did raise his
voice on high, and he
spake, saying,
</p>

<p>
14 What of the land
<i>of</i> Amer?  And what <i>of</i>
it?  Verily, a pin that
lieth in <i>the way</i>, it is of
more account than a
spike that lifteth its
head <i>at a</i> distance.
</p>

<p>
15 And the iron heel
of Hu, it levelleth all
things; neither shall
<i>any man</i> dare to withstand it.
</p>

<p>
16 And when he had
finished speaking, he
sent out messengers
<i>unto</i> the four corners of
the earth, instructing
them that they should
tell <i>these things</i> unto all
people, for he was a
boastful fellow and a
braggart, <i>for ever</i>
holding forth in large
manner for to be heard of
all the world.
</p>

<p>
17 Now Wudro, the
son of Wyl, <i>after that</i>
he had made him war,
he cried not out from
the housetops what
things he would do, but
he gat him about it for
<i>to do</i> them.
</p>

<p>
18 And he opened
wide the strings of his
purse so that the
shekels, they gushed <i>forth</i>
as the waters of a brook
after rain.
</p>

<p>
19 And he sent much
munition of war unto
them that were <i>with
him</i>, and he commanded
his physicians that they
should go out for to
succour the wounded.
</p>

<p>
20 And he <i>did send</i>
his vessels of war also,
which were useful
things and ready for the
fray.  And of men that
did fly <i>in</i> the air, he
sent also <i>of these</i>, an
eager band <i>and</i> valiant.
</p>

<p>
21 Neither was he
backward in the matter
of food, making due
provision in <i>all</i> things.
And he did set him
about it for to build
him an army, a mighty
host <i>such as</i> never
before was seen.  And he
rested him not, neither
in the day nor in the
night did he rest him,
doing <i>always</i> those
things that were requisite
<i>for the</i> undertaking.
</p>

<p>
22 And when word
was brought unto Willi
that Wudro, he had
taken the coat from off
his back, and that he
was labouring without
any respite, he grew
sore afraid, and <i>he did</i>
shake all over with the
violence of the tremble
of his knees.
</p>

<p>
23 And when he was
recovered by a potion of
strong drink, he <i>did</i>
call the Ministers of
State unto his chamber,
and he spake unto them,
saying, Is there no one
<i>now</i> amongst the men of
peace <i>that will</i> raise his
voice against this bloody
war?
</p>

<p>
24 And, lo, straightway,
<i>there was</i> a voice,
and it spake concerning
peace.  And it was
blown along by the
wind, even unto the
land of Amer <i>was it</i>
blown.
</p>

<p>
25 And when it was
come unto the ears of
Wudro, that was the son
of Wyl, he made answer
unto it, and he did say,
Verily, it hath a goodly
sound.  <i>Nevertheless</i>,
this peace, it shall not
come to pass, for the
king of Hu, <i>he hath</i> a
lying tongue, and his
plighted word, hath he
not broken it before?
</p>

<p>
26 And because he is
<i>what</i> he is, therefore
shall the compact of
peace be made only
with that man which he
is not.
</p>

<p>
27 And the words of
Wudro, they were blown
along by the wind, even
back from the land of
Amer <i>were they</i> blown
on the wings of the
wind.

CHAPTER XVII.
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Take heed, my son,
and hearken unto
the words of Artemas,
for there <i>are</i> many that
will give thee counsel,
yet wisdom <i>cometh</i> only
from the few.
</p>

<p>
2 Put not thy trust in
princes, for their bond
is of paper that teareth
<i>easily</i>.  And their
plighted word melteth
like butter, before the
heat of their necessity.
</p>

<p>
3 Beware of the king
whose pledge runneth
<i>away</i> like water, for the
skins of such shall
paper the walls of hell.
</p>

<p>
4 A man devoured of
ambition, he lieth easily;
nevertheless, <i>there
cometh</i> a time when
even fools believe him
not.
</p>

<p>
5 Beware of the woman
that followeth thee
about, for she is <i>after</i>
thy regimental buttons.
</p>

<p>
6 And if she is safe,
then is she a fool; but if
she is <i>otherwise</i>, then is
she the devil.
</p>

<p>
7 A woman hunteth
thee.  She lieth in wait
to surprise thee, and
will <i>out upon thee</i> when
the time cometh.
</p>

<p>
8 Flee unto the
mountains; pitch thou
thy tent <i>afar</i> in the
wilderness; take thou
sail across the waters
until thou comest unto a
strange coast.  Nevertheless,
<i>because</i> she has
marked thee down,
<i>therefore</i> will she have
thee.
</p>

<p>
9 When thou goest
forth for to fight, take
care that thou smitest
thine enemy in the back,
for <i>it is</i> the mark of a
good fighter so to do.
</p>

<p>
10 Also, he that
shooteth his enemy
<i>through</i> the head
sheddeth light upon his
understanding.
</p>

<p>
11 When the foe doth
stand two in a line,
shoot thou thy bolt, for
then will thine execution
be twofold.  Verily
I say unto thee, <i>Await</i>
thine opportunity, for a
shell in time is as good
as a mine.
</p>

<p>
12 Remember, my
son, that the sum of two
and two <i>maketh</i> four;
yet in the reports of
thine enemy thou shalt
find it otherwise.
</p>

<p>
13 And because <i>the
pen</i> is mightier than the
sword, therefore believe
it not, else shalt thou
surely be deceived.
</p>

<p>
14 Verily I say unto
thee, Blessed is the man
that <i>hath</i> imagination,
for his country <i>shall</i>
win many battles.
</p>

<p>
15 Take ye heed <i>of
the</i> lone voice, for in a
multitude of counsellors
thou <i>shalt</i> find confusion.
</p>

<p>
16 And an arsenal
that is full of munitions
is better than an hundred
rulers full <i>of</i>
words.
</p>

<p>
17 Hearken not unto
the boasting of thine
enemy and regard him
not, for no man knoweth
what <i>the day</i> may bring
forth.
</p>

<p>
18 And in the time of
its adversity the soul of
a country revealeth <i>itself</i>.
</p>

<p>
19 Get thee about it
and do things, for the
voice of the sluggard
dieth in his throat, but
the worker is heard
from afar off.
</p>

<p>
20 Make thou thy
task according to thy
strength, for no man
that weareth costly
teeth doth gnaw at the
bones of an elephant.
</p>

<p>
21 Make <i>thy life</i>
wisely, O my son, lest
thy neighbours speak ill
concerning thee.  And
if thou shouldst stray
<i>from</i> the narrow path,
remember the other,
that it is of sand.
</p>

<p>
22 Wherefore, <i>tread</i>
lightly.  For he that
leaveth his footprint
<i>behind</i>, his foolishness
condemns him.  But the
<i>prudent</i> sinner is
exalted unto heaven, <i>and</i>
his name, it exhaleth a
very sweet perfume.
</p>

<p>
23 For whosoever
sups with the devil <i>in a
place</i> where men pass
by, shall he not, <i>therefore</i>,
turn out the light?
</p>

<p>
24 Woe unto the
peacemongers that entice
thee <i>with</i> words, for
these do seek thine undoing.
</p>

<p>
25 Thy way leadeth
over stony ground, and
to go back, it is <i>the
manner</i> of a coward.
</p>

<p>
26 For whosoever
setteth his hand to the
plow, he shall not turn
back; and he that
finisheth a furrow, <i>he hath</i>
not plowed the field.
</p>

<p>
27 What man gathereth
him the blossom of
the apple tree?  Rather
doth he wait until the
fruit cometh, big and
full of juice; then doth
he eat of it.
</p>

<p>
28 Avoid thou them
that seek to divide the
people, one against the
other, for <i>they are</i>
traitors in the land.
</p>

<p>
29 Turn not away
from instruction, O my
son, but open thine ears
full wide, for wisdom
maketh a fair mistress
<i>and</i> she is youthful for
all time.
</p>

<p>
30 And he that followeth
after her, his life
shall be well ordered
and his affairs shall fall
out <i>just so</i>.
</p>

<p>
31 Thou shalt rule
<i>thy</i> comings in and <i>thy</i>
goings out according to
circumstance, so that
nothing ariseth amiss;
for a thirst <i>that is</i> born
at a proper time, it
maketh the publican smile;
but a thirst that cometh
late is an affliction unto
him that <i>hath</i> it.
</p>

<p>
32 Take heed, my
son, and hearken unto
the words of Artemas,
for there <i>are</i> many that
will give thee counsel,
yet wisdom <i>cometh</i> only
from the few.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
